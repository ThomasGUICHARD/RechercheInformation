Charles Emile Picard (usually referred to simply as Emile Picard) (
July 24, 
1856 - 
December 12, 
1941) was a leading 

French
 
mathematician.

Picard's mathematical papers, textbooks, and many popular writings exhibit an extraordinary range of interests, as well as an impressive mastery of the mathematics of his time. Modern students of 
complex variables are probably familiar with two of his named theorems. His lesser theorem states that every nonconstant 
entire function takes every value in the 
complex plane, with perhaps one exception. His greater theorem states that an 
analytic function with an 
essential singularity takes every value infinitely often, with perhaps one exception, in any neighborhood of the singularity. He also made important contributions in the theory of 
differential equations, including work on 
Painleve transcendents and his introduction of a kind of 
symmetry group for a linear differential equation, the 



Picard group


. In connection with his work on function theory, he was one of the first mathematicians to use the emerging ideas of 
algebraic topology.
In addition to his path-breaking theoretical work, 
Picard also made important contributions to 
applied mathematics,
including the theories of telegraphy and elasticity. His collected papers run to four volumes.


Like his contemporary, 
Henri Poincare, Picard was much concerned with the training of mathematics, physics, and engineering students.
He wrote a classic textbook on 
analysis-- which is still considered a standard reference-- as well as one of the first textbooks on the 
theory of relativity. 
Picard's popular writings include biographies of many leading French mathematicians, including his father in law, 


Charles Hermite

.


In 1924, he was elected to the 
Academie francaise.

Sucre (population 247,300 in 2006) is the constitutional 
capital of 
Bolivia, seat of the Supreme Court (Corte Suprema de Justicia), and capital of the 
Chuquisaca department. Located in the south-central part of the country, Sucre lies at an altitude of 2750m (9,000ft). Its lower altitude gives the city a warm temperate climate year-round.


On 
November 30 
1538 Sucre was founded under the name Ciudad de la Plata de la Nueva Toledo by 
Pedro Anzures, Marques de Campo Redondo. In 
1538 the 



Spanish


 


King Philip II

 established the 



Audiencia


 de Charcas in La Plata with authority over an area which covers what is now 

Paraguay
, southeastern 






Peru





, Northern 










Chile









 and 


Argentina

, and much of 
Bolivia. The Audiencia de Charcas was a subdivision of the 

Viceroyalty of Peru
. In 
1601 the Recoleta Monastery was founded by the Franciscans and in 
1609, an 
archbishopric was founded in the city. In 
1624, 
St Francis Xavier University of Chuquisaca was founded.


Very much a Spanish city during the colonial era, the narrow streets of the city centre are organised in a grid, reflecting the Andalusian culture that is embodied in the architecture of the city's great houses and numerous convents and churches. Sucre remains the seat of the Catholic church in Bolivia, and a common sight is members of religious orders dressed in traditional costume. For much of its colonial history, Sucre's temperate climate was preferred by the Spanish royalty and wealthy families involved in silver trade coming from 
Potosi. Testament to this is the 
Glorieta Castle. Sucre's University (Universidad Real   Pontifice de San Francisco Xavier de Chuquisaca) is one of the oldest universities in the new world.



Festival time in 
Sucre



Until the 19th century, La Plata was the judicial, religious and cultural centre of the region. In 1839, after the city became the capital of Bolivia, it was renamed in honour of the revolutionary leader 
Antonio Jose de Sucre. Too remote after the economic decline of 
Potosi and its silver industry, it saw the Bolivian seat of government move to 
La Paz in 1898. Many argue Sucre was the epicenter that initiated the independence campaign against Spain in all of Latin America. The first  Grito Libertario  (Shout for Freedom) in any Western Hemisphere Spanish colony of took place in Sucre in 1809. Ironically, Bolivia was the last territory to gain its independence in 1825. In 1991, Sucre became a 


UNESCO

 







World Heritage Site






.


The city attracts thousands of tourists every year thanks to its well-conserved downtown with buildings from the 18th and 19th centuries. Nestled at the foot of the twin hills of 
Churuquella and 
Sika Sika, Sucre is the gateway to numerous small villages that date from the colonial era, the most well-known of which is 








Tarabuco







, home of the colorful  
Pujllay  festival held each March. Most of these villagers are members of one of the indigenous ethnicities. Many dress in clothing distinctive to their respective villages. 



 The City of Four Names 


Sucre is also called  The City of Four Names . Each of the well known names represent a specific era of the city's history.





 Charcas was the indigenous name for the place upon which the Spaniards built the colonial city.


 La Plata was the name given to the emerging Hispanic city of privilege and honor.


 The name 
Chuquisaca was bestowed upon the city during the independence era.


 Sucre honors the great marshal of the 

Battle of Ayacucho
 (December 9, 1824), Don 
Antonio Jose de Sucre.

The Secretary of War was a member of the 








United States







 

President's
 
Cabinet, beginning with 





George Washington




's administration. A similar position, called either  Secretary at War  or  Secretary of War,  was appointed to serve the 





Congress of the Confederation




 under the 

Articles of Confederation
 between 1781 and 1789.  

Benjamin Lincoln
 and later 

Henry Knox
 held the position. When Washington was inaugurated as the first president under the 

Constitution
, he appointed Knox to continue serving. 

The Secretary of War led the 
War Department. At first, he was responsible for all military affairs. In 1798, the 









Secretary of the Navy








 was added to the cabinet, and the scope of this office was reduced to a general concern with the Army. In 1947, the departments were recombined under the 









Secretary of Defense








. The Secretary of War was replaced by the 
Secretary of the Army and the 
Secretary of the Air Force, non-Cabinet positions under the 









Secretary of Defense

Alexander Joan Cuza (a common, old English rendition of Alexandru Ioan Cuza; 
March 20, 
1820   
May 15, 
1873) was a 

Moldavia
n-born 

Romania
n politician who ruled as the first 









Domnitor








 of the 
United Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia between 1859 and 1866.



Early life


Born in 
Hu i, Cuza (with the old French spelling  Couza ) belonged to the traditional 
boyar class in Moldavia, being the son of 
Ispravnic Ioan Cuza (who was also a landowner in 
F lciu County) and his wife Sultana (or Soltana), a member of the 
Cozadini family of 




Phanariote



 origins. Alexander received an urbane European education, becoming an officer in the 



Moldavian Army


 (rising to the rank of 
colonel). He married 
Elena Rosetti in 1844.


In 1848, known as the 
year of European revolutions, Moldavia and 

Wallachia
 fell into revolt. The 
Moldavian unrest was quickly suppressed, but in Wallachia the revolutionaries took power and governed during the summer (see 
1848 Wallachian revolution). Young Cuza played a prominent enough part to establish his 
liberal credentials during the Moldavian episode and to be shipped to 


Vienna

 as a prisoner, where he soon made his escape with 
British support.


Returned during the rule of 
Prince 
Grigore Alexandru Ghica, he became Moldavia's minister of war in 1858, and represented 
Gala i in the 
ad hoc Divan at 
Ia i, acting under the guarantee of the 
European Powers in the wake of the 

Crimean War
 to nominate a prince for Moldavia. Cuza was a prominent speaker in the debates and strongly advocated the union of Moldavia and Walachia. In default of a foreign prince, he was himself nominated in both countries by the pro-unionist 
Partida Na ional  (profiting from an ambiguity in the text of the governing 















Treaty of Paris














) and elected prince of Moldavia on 
January 17, 
1859 (January 5, 
Julian) and, after street pressure changed the vote in 

Bucharest
, of Wallachia on 
February 5, 
1859 (January 24, Julian).


Although he and his wife 
Elena Rosetti had no children, she raised as her own children his two sons by his mistress 
Elena Maria Catargiu-Obrenovi : 
Alexandru Al. Ioan Cuza (born between 1862 and 1864 - 1889), and 
Dimitrie Cuza (1865 - 1888 
suicide).




Reign



Diplomatic efforts


Thus Cuza achieved a 
de facto union of the two principalites. The Powers backtracked, 



Napoleon III


 of the 

French Empire
 remaining supportive, while the 










Austrian









 ministry withheld approval of such a union at the Congress of Paris (October 18, 1858); partly as a consequence, Cuza's authority was not recognized by his nominal 
suzerain, 
Abdulaziz, the 
Sultan of the 

Ottoman Empire
, until 
December 23, 
1861, (and, even then, the union was only accepted for the duration of Cuza's rule). 


The union was formally declared three years later, on 
February 5, 
1862, (January 24, Julian), the new country bearing the name of Romania, with Bucharest as its capital city.





Cuza in the 1860s; portrait by 
August Strixner



Cuza invested his diplomatic actions in gaining further concessions from the Powers: the sultan's assent to a 

single unified parliament
 and 

cabinet
 for Cuza's lifetime, in recognition of the complexity of the task. Thus, he was regarded as the political embodiment of a unified Romania.




Reforms


Assisted by his councilor 
Mihail Kog lniceanu, an intellectual leader of the 1848 revolution, Cuza initiated a series of reforms that contributed to the modernization of Romanian society and of state structures.


His first measure addressed a need for increasing the land resources and revenues available to the state, by 
 secularizing  (confiscating) monastic assets (1863). Probably more than a quarter of Romania's farmland was controlled by untaxed 
Eastern Orthodox  
Dedicated Monasteries , which supported 

Greek
 and other foreign monks in shrines such as 


Mount Athos

 and 













Jerusalem












 (a substantial drain on state revenues). Cuza got his parliament's backing to expropriate these lands. He offered compensation to the 

Greek Orthodox Church
, but 
Sophronius III, the 
Patriarch of Constantinople, refused to negotiate; after several years, the Romanian government withdrew its offer and no compensation was ever paid. State revenues thereby increased without adding any domestic tax burden.


The 
land reform, liberating peasants from the last 
corvees, freeing their movements and redistributing some land (1864), was less successful. In attempting to create a solid support base among the peasants, Cuza soon found himself in conflict with the group of 
Conservatives. A liberal bill granting peasants title to the land they worked was defeated. Then the Conservatives responded with a bill that ended all peasant dues and responsibilities, but gave landlords title to all the land. Cuza 
vetoed it, then held a 
plebiscite to alter the Paris Convention (the virtual 
constitution), in the manner of Napoleon III.


His plan to establish 
universal manhood suffrage, together with the power of the Domnitor to rule by decree, passed by a vote of 682,621 to 1,307. He consequently governed the country under the provisions of Statutul dezvolt tor al Conven iei de la Paris ( Statute expanding the Paris Convention ), an 






organic law





 adopted on 





July 15




, 
1864. With his new plenary powers, Cuza then promulgated the Agrarian Law of 1863. Peasants received title to the land they worked, while landlords retained ownership of one third. Where there was not enough land available to create workable farms under this formula, state lands (from the confiscated monasteries) would be used to give the landowners compensation.

Honore Daumier in 










Le Charivari









 (May 5, 1866). A character symbolising the 
Danubian Principalities, looking on as the Foreign Powers charged with overseeing him quarrel: Oh, my! It looks as if they are no longer taking care of me at all!''





Despite the attempts by 
Lasc r Catargiu's cabinet to force a transition in which some corvees were to be maintained, Cuza's reform marked the disappearance of the boyar class as a 
privileged group, and led to a channeling of energies into 
capitalism and 
industrialization; at the same time, however, land distributed was still below necessities, and the problem became stringent over the following decades - as peasants reduced to destitution sold off their land or found that it was insufficient for the needs of their growing families.


Cuza's reforms also included the adoption of the Criminal Code and the Civil Code based on the 


Napoleonic code

 (1864), a Law on Education, establishing 
tuition-free, 

compulsory
 
public education for 
primary schools (1864; the system, nonetheless, suffered from drastic shortages in allocated funds). He founded the 
University of Ia i (1860) and the 

University of Bucharest
 (1864), and helped develop of a modern, European-style 
Romanian Army, under a working relationship with France.





Downfall and exile


Cuza failed in his effort to create an alliance of prosperous peasants and a strong liberal prince, ruling as a benevolent authoritarian in the style of Napoleon III. Having to rely on a decreasing group of hand-picked 
bureaucrats, Cuza began facing a mounting opposition after his land reform bill, with liberal landowners voicing concerns over his ability to represent their interests. Along with financial distress, there was an awkward scandal that revolved around his mistress, 
Maria Catargi-Obrenovi , and popular discontent culminated in a 
coup d'etat. Cuza was forced to abdicate by the so-called Monstrous Coalition of Conservatives and Liberals. At four o'clock on the morning of 
February 22, 
1866, a group of military conspirators broke into the palace, and compelled the prince to sign his 
abdication. On the following day they conducted him safely across the frontier. 


His successor, Prince 

Karl of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen
, was proclaimed Domnitor as Carol I of Romania on 
March 26, 
1866. The election of a foreign prince with ties to an important princely house, legitimizing Romanian independence (which Carol came to do after the 
Russo-Turkish War of 1877 1878), had been one of the liberal aims in the revolution of 1848. Despite the participation of 
Ion Br tianu and other future leaders of the 

Liberal Party
 in the overthrow of Cuza, he remained a hero to the 

radical
 and 
republican wing, who, as 
Francophiles, had an additional reason to oppose a 

Prussia
n monarch; anti-Carol riots in Bucharest during the 

Franco-Prussian War
 (see 
History of Bucharest) and the coup attempt known as the 
Republic of Ploie ti in August 1870, the conflict was eventually resolved by the compromise between Br tianu and Carol, with the arrival of a prolonged and influential Liberal cabinet.  


Cuza spent the remainder of his life in exile, chiefly in 

Paris
, 


Vienna

 and 

Wiesbaden
, accompanied by his wife, his mistress, and his two sons. He died in 

Heidelberg
. His remains were buried in his residence in 
Ruginoasa, but were moved to the 
Trei Ierarhi Cathedral in Ia i after 







World War II

A room in the Telecity colocation centre in 





Aubervilliers




, a suburb of 

Paris




A colocation centre (collocation center) ( colo ) or carrier hotel is a type of 
data center where multiple customers locate network, server and storage gear and interconnect to a variety of telecommunications and other network service provider(s) with a minimum of cost and complexity.


Increasingly organizations are recognizing the benefits of colocating their mission-critical equipment within a data centre. Colocation is becoming popular because of the time and cost savings a company can realize as result of using shared data centre infrastructure.  Significant benefits of scale (large power and mechanical systems) result in large colocation facilities, typically 4500 to 9500 square metres (roughly 50000 to 100000 square feet). With IT and communications facilities in safe, secure hands, telecommunications, internet, 
ASP and content providers, as well as enterprises, enjoy less latency and the freedom to focus on their core business.


Additionally, customers reduce their traffic back-haul costs and free up their internal networks for other uses. Moreover, by outsourcing network traffic to a colocation service provider with greater 
bandwidth capacity, web site access speeds should improve considerably.


Major types of colocation customers are:





 Web commerce companies, who use the facilities for a safe environment and cost-effective, redundant connections to the Internet


 Major enterprises, who use the facility for disaster avoidance, offsite data backup and business continuity


 Telecommunication companies, who use the facilities to interexchange traffic with other telecommunications companies and access to potential clients




Most 
network access point facilities provide colocation.



Building features





A typical server rack, commonly seen in colocation.







Fire protection systems, including 
passive and 
active design elements, as well as implementation of 
fire prevention programs in operations. 
Smoke detectors are usually installed to provide early warning of a developing fire by detecting particles generated by smoldering components prior to the development of flame. This allows investigation, interruption of power, and manual fire suppression using hand held fire extinguishers before the fire grows to a large size. A 
fire sprinkler system is often provided to control a full scale fire if it develops. 
Clean agent fire suppression gaseous systems are sometimes installed to suppress a fire earlier than the fire sprinkler system. Passive fire protection elements include the installation of 
 fire walls around the space, so a fire can be restricted to a portion of the facility for a limited time in the event of the failure of the active fire protection systems, or if they are not installed.





19-inch rack

s for data equipment and servers, 23-inch racks for telecom equipment.


Cabinets and cages for physical access control over tenants' equipment.


Overhead cable rack (tray) and fiberguide, power cables usually on separate rack from data.



Air conditioning is used to control the temperature and humidity in the space. 
ASHRAE recommends a temperature range of 20 25  C and humidity range of 40 60% as optimal for electronic equipment conditions. The electrical power used by the electronic equipment is converted to heat, which is rejected to the ambient air in the data center space. Unless the heat is removed, the ambient temperature will rise, resulting in electronic equipment malfunction. By controlling the space air temperature, the server components at the board level are kept within the manufacturer's specified temperature/humidity range.  Air conditioning systems help control space 
humidity within acceptable parameters by cooling the return space air below the 
dew point. Too much humidity and water may begin to 
condense on internal components. In case of a dry atmosphere, ancillary humidification systems may add water vapor to the space if the space humidy is too low, which can result in 
static electricity discharge problems which may damage components.  


Low-impedance electrical 
ground.


Few, if any, windows.






Physical security


Most colocation centres have high levels of physical security, and may be guarded continuously.  They may employ 
closed-circuit television camera.


Some colocation facilities require that employees escort customers, especially if there are not individual locked cages/cabinets for each customer.  In other facilities, a 
PIN code or 
proximity card access system may allow customers access into the building, and individual cages/cabinets have locks.  
Biometric security measures, such as 
fingerprint recognition, 
voice recognition and  weight matching , are also becoming more commonplace in modern facilities.




Power


Colocation facilities generally have 

generators
 that start automatically when utility power fails, usually running on 
diesel fuel. These generators may have varying levels of redundancy, depending on how the facility is built.


Generators do not start instantaneously, so colocation facilities usually have battery backup systems.  In many facilities, the operator of the facility provides large inverters to provide AC power from the batteries.  In other cases, the customers may install smaller 




UPSes



 in their racks.


Some customers choose to use equipment that is powered directly by 48VDC (nominal) battery banks.  This may provide better energy efficiency, and may reduce the number of parts that can fail.


An alternative to batteries is a motor generator connected to a 
flywheel and diesel engine.


Many colocation facilities can provide A and B power feeds to customer equipment, and high end servers and telecommunications equipment often can have two power supplies installed.


Colocation facilities are sometimes connected to multiple sections of the utility power grid for additional reliability.




Cooling


The operator of a colocation facility generally provides 
air conditioning for the computer and telecommunications equipment in the building.  The cooling system generally includes some degree of redundancy


In older facilities, the cooling system capacity often limits the amount of equipment that can operate in the building, more so than the available square footage.




Internal connections


Colocation facility owners have differing rules regarding cross connects between their customers.  These rules may allow customers to run such connections at no charge, or allow customers to order such connections for a significant monthly fee. They may allow customers to order cross connects to carriers, but not to other customers.


Some colocation centres feature a  
meet-me-room  where the different carriers housed in the centre can efficiently exchange data.


Most 
peering points sit in colocation centres.


Because of the high concentration of servers inside larger colocation centres, most carriers will be interested in bringing direct connections to such buildings.


In many cases there will be a larger 
Internet Exchange hosted inside a colocation centre, where customers can connect for peering.




External connections


Colocation facilities generally have multiple locations for fiber optic cables to enter the building, to provide redundancy so that communications can continue if one bundle of cables is damaged.

Mystery religions
Eleusinian Mysteries
Festivals in Ancient Greece




The Eleusinian Mysteries (

Greek
:                   ) were 
initiation ceremonies held every year for the 
cult of 

Demeter
 and 

Persephone
 based at 
Eleusis in 
ancient Greece. Of all the mysteries celebrated in ancient times, these were held to be the ones of greatest importance. These myths and 







mysteries






, begun in the Mycenean period (c. 1700 BC) and lasting two thousand years, were a major festival during the Hellenic era, later spreading to 
Rome.1

The rites, ceremonies, and beliefs were kept secret, as initiation was believed to unite the worshipper with the gods and included promises of divine power and rewards in 
the afterlife.2  There are many paintings and pieces of pottery that depict various aspects of the Mysteries.  Since the Mysteries involved visions and conjuring of an afterlife, some scholars believe that the power and longevity of the Eleusinian Mysteries came from psychedelic agents.



 Mythology of Demeter and Persephone 





The Mysteries seem to be related to a myth concerning Demeter, the goddess of agriculture and fertility as recounted in one of the 




Homeric Hymns



 (c. 650 B.C.). According to the hymn, Demeter's daughter Persephone (also referred to as Kore,  girl ) was gathering flowers with friends, when she was seized by her uncle, 



Hades


, the god of death and the underworld, with the consent of her father Zeus.  He took her to his underworld kingdom. Distraught, Demeter searched high and low for her daughter. Because of her distress, and in an effort to coerce Zeus to allow the return of her daughter, she caused a terrible 
drought in which the people suffered and starved.  This would have deprived the gods of sacrifice and worship. As a result of this Zeus relents and allows Persephone to return to her mother.3


According to the myth, during her search, Demeter traveled long distances and had many minor adventures along the way.  In one instance, she teaches the secrets of 
agriculture to 





Triptolemus




.4 Finally, by consulting 

Zeus
, Demeter reunites with her daughter and the earth returns to its former verdure and prosperity: the first spring. (For more information on this story, see 

Demeter
.) Before allowing Persephone to return to her mother, Hades offered her a great feast as she was hungry and Persephone ate 6 seeds of a 
pomegranate. As a result, Persephone could not avoid returning to the underworld for part of the year. According to the prevailing version of the myth, Persephone had to remain with Hades for six months (one month per seed) while staying above ground with her mother for a similar period. This left a large period of time when Demeter was unhappy due to Persephone's absence therefore she did not cultivate the Earth and it withered, however, when Persephone returned to the surface she became joyful and cared for the Earth again. However, six months of winter was unlikely and it is easier to believe that Persephone stayed with Hades for four months and Demeter eight months. The end result was eight months of growth and abundance to be followed by four months of no productivity.5 These periods correspond well with the Mediterranean climate of Ancient Greece. The four months during which Persephone is with Hades correspond to the dry Greek summer, a period during which plants are threatened with drought.6 After the first rains in the fall, when the seeds are planted, Persephone returns from the Underworld and the cycle of growth begins anew.


The Eleusinian Mysteries probably included a celebration of Persephone's return, for it was also the return of plants and of life to the earth. Persephone had gone into the 
underworld (underground, like seeds in the winter), then returned to the land of the living: her rebirth is symbolic of the rebirth of all plant life during Spring and, by extension, all life on earth.




The Mysteries


The Eleusinian Mysteries are believed to have begun about 1700 BC, during the 

Mycenean Age
. One line of thought by modern scholars has been that these Mysteries were intended  to elevate man above the human sphere into the divine and to assure his redemption by making him a god and so conferring immortality upon him. 7 


The lesser mysteries were probably held every year; the greater mysteries only every five years.8 This cycle continued for about two millennia. In the 




Homeric Hymn



 to Demeter, King 










Celeus









 is said to have been one of the first people to learn the secret rites and mysteries of her cult. He was also one of her original priests, along with 





Diocles




, 
Eumolpos, 
Polyxeinus and 





Triptolemus




, Celeus' son, who had supposedly learned agriculture from Demeter.9


Under 

Pisistratus
 of Athens, the Eleusinian Mysteries became pan-Hellenic and pilgrims flocked from Greece and beyond to participate.  Around 300 BC, the state took over control of the Mysteries; they were specifically controlled by two families, the 
Eumolpidae and the 
Kerykes. This led to a vast increase in the number of initiates. The only requirements for membership were a lack of  blood guilt , meaning having never committed murder, and not being a  barbarian  (unable to speak Greek). Men, women and even slaves were allowed initiation.10



Participants


There were four categories of people who participated in the Eleusinian Mysteries:




Priests, priestesses and 
hierophants.


Initiates, undergoing the ceremony for the first time.


Others who had already participated at least once. They were eligible for the fourth category.


Those who had attained epopteia, who had learned the secrets of the greatest mysteries of Demeter.






Secrets


The outline below is only a capsule summary; much of the concrete information about the Eleusinian Mysteries was never written down. For example, only initiates knew what the kiste, a sacred chest, and the kalathos, a lidded basket, contained. The contents, like so much about the Mysteries, are unknown.  However, one researcher writes that this Cista ( kiste ) contained a golden mystical serpent, egg, a phallus and possibly also seeds sacred to Demeter.11




Greater and Lesser Mysteries


There were two Eleusinian Mysteries, the Greater and the Lesser. According to 





Thomas Taylor




,  the dramatic shows of the Lesser Mysteries occultly signified the miseries of the soul while in subjection to the body, so those of the Greater obscurely intimated, by mystic and splendid visions, the felicity of the soul both here and hereafter, when purified from the defilements of a material nature and constantly elevated to the realities of intellectual [spiritual] vision.  And that according to Plato,  the ultimate design of the Mysteries   was to lead us back to the principles from which we descended,   a perfect enjoyment of intellectual [spiritual] good. 12


The Lesser Mysteries were held in Anthesterion (March) but the exact time was not always fixed and changed occasionally, unlike the Greater Mysteries. The priests purified the candidates for initiation (myesis). They first sacrificed a pig to Demeter then purified themselves.


The Greater Mysteries took place in 
Boedromion (the first month of the 



Attic calendar


, falling in late Summer) and lasted ten days.




Greater Mysteries 






 

For among the many excellent and indeed divine institutions which your Athens has brought forth and contributed to human life, none, in my opinion, is better than those mysteries. For by their means we have been brought out of our barbarous and savage mode of life and educated and refined to a state of civilization; and as the rites are called  initiations,  so in very truth we have learned from them the beginnings of life, and have gained the power not only to live happily, but also to die with a better hope.

 



 Cicero, Laws II, xiv, 36



The first act (14th Boedromion) of the Greater Mysteries was the bringing of the sacred objects from Eleusis to the 
Eleusinion, a temple at the base of the 
Acropolis.


On 15th Boedromion, called Agyrmos, the hierophants (priests) declared 
prorrhesis, the start of the rites, and carried out the  Hither the victims  sacrifice  (hiereia deuro). The  Seawards initiates  (halade mystai) began in Athens on 16th Boedromion with the celebrants washing themselves in the sea at 
Phaleron. 


On 17th Boedromion, the participants began the Epidauria, a festival for 
Asklepios named after his main sanctuary at 
Epidauros.  This  festival within a festival  celebrated the hero's arrival at Athens with his daughter 
Hygieia, and consisted of a procession leading to the Eleusinion, during which the mystai apparently stayed at home, a great sacrifice, and an all-night feast (pannychis).13


The procession to Eleusis began at 







Kerameikos






 (the Athenian cemetery) on the 19th Boedromion from where the people walked to Eleusis, along what was called the  Sacred Way  (         ), swinging branches called 
bacchoi. At a certain spot along the way, they shouted obscenities in commemoration of 




Iambe



 (or 







Baubo






), an old woman who, by cracking dirty jokes, had made Demeter smile as she mourned the loss of her daughter. The procession also shouted  Iakch' o Iakche!,  referring to 










Iacchus









, possibly an epithet for 

Dionysus
, or a separate deity, son of Persephone or Demeter.


Upon reaching Eleusis, there was a day of fasting in commemoration of Demeter's fasting while searching for Persephone.  The fast was broken while drinking a special drink of barley and 
pennyroyal, called 
kykeon. Then on 20th and 21st Boedromion, the initiates entered a great hall called 







Telesterion






; in the center stood the Anaktoron ( palace ), which only the hierophantes could enter, where sacred objects were stored. Here, in the Telesterion, the initiates were shown the sacred relics of Demeter. This was the most secretive part of the Mysteries and those who had been initiated were forbidden to ever speak of the events that took place in the Telesterion. The penalty was death. 
Athenagoras of Athens claims that it was for this crime (among others) that 
Diagoras had received the death penalty.


As to the climax of the Mysteries, there are two modern theories. Some hold that the priests were the ones to reveal the visions of the holy night, consisting of a fire that represented the possibility of life after death, and various sacred objects. Others hold this explanation to be insufficient to account for the power and longevity of the Mysteries, and that the experiences must have been internal and mediated by a powerful psychoactive ingredient contained in the kykeon drink. (See  










entheogenic theories









  below.)


Following this section of the Mysteries was the Pannychis, an all-night feast accompanied by dancing and merriment. The dances took place in the 








Rharian Field







, rumored to be the first spot where grain grew. A bull sacrifice also took place late that night or early the next morning. That day (22nd Boedromion), the initiates honored the dead by pouring 
libations from special vessels.


On 23rd Boedromion, the Mysteries ended and everyone returned home.14





End of the Eleusinian Mysteries


In 170 AD, the Temple of Demeter was sacked by the 

Sarmatians
 but was rebuilt by 

Marcus Aurelius
. Aurelius was then allowed to become the only lay-person to ever enter the anaktoron. As Christianity gained in popularity in the 4th and 5th centuries, Eleusis' prestige began to fade. 


Julian

 was the last emperor to be initiated into the Eleusinian Mysteries.15


The 

Roman
 emperor 


Theodosius I

 closed the sanctuaries by decree in 392 AD as part of his effort to suppress Hellenist resistance to the imposition of 


Christianity

 as a 
state religion. The last remnants of the Mysteries were wiped out in 396 AD, when 
Alaric, King of the 



Goths


, invaded accompanied by Christians  in their dark garments , bringing 


Arian

 Christianity and desecrating the old sacred sites.16 The closing of the Eleusinian Mysteries in the 4th century is reported by 
Eunapios, a historian and biographer of the Greek philosophers. Eunapios had been initiated by the last legitimate 










Hierophant









, who had been commissioned by the emperor 


Julian

 to restore the Mysteries, which had by then fallen into decay. According to Eunapios, the very last Hierophant was a usurper,  the man from 








Thespiae







 who held the rank of Father in the mysteries of 
Mithras. 




 The Mysteries in art 


There are many paintings and pieces of pottery that depict various aspects of the Mysteries. The 
Eleusinian Relief, from late 5th century BC, displayed in the 

National Archaeological Museum of Athens
 is a representative example. Triptolemus is depicted receiving seeds from Demeter and teaching mankind how to work the fields to grow crops, with Persephone holding her hand over his head to protect him.17  Vases and other works of relief sculpture, from the 
4th, 
5th and 
6th centuries BC, depict Triptolemus holding an ear of corn, sitting on a winged throne or chariot, surrounded by Persephone and Demeter with pine torches.


The 







Ninnion Tablet






, found in the same museum, depicts Demeter, followed by Persephone and Iacchus, and then the procession of initiates. Then, Demeter is sitting on the kiste inside the Telesterion, with Persephone holding a torch and introducing the initiates. The initiates each hold a bacchoi. The second row of initiates were led by 
Iakchos, a priest who held torches for the ceremonies. He is standing near the 
omphalos while an unknown female (probably a priestess of Demeter) sat nearby on the kiste, holding a scepter and a vessel filled with kykeon. Pannychis is also represented.18


In 
Shakespeare's 








The Tempest







, the 
masque that Prospero conjures to celebrate the troth-pledging of Miranda and Ferdinand echoes the Eleusinian Mysteries, although it uses the Roman names for the deities involved - Ceres, Iris, Dis and others - instead of the Greek. It is interesting that a play which is so steeped in esoteric imagery from 
alchemy and 
hermeticism should draw on the Mysteries for its central masque sequence.





Entheogenic theories


Some scholars believe that the power of the Eleusinian Mysteries came from the 
kykeon's functioning as a 
psychedelic agent.19 Barley may be 
parasitized by the 
fungus 
ergot, which contains the 
psychoactive alkaloids 

lysergic acid amide (LSA)
, a precursor to 
LSD and 
ergonovine. It is possible that a psychoactive potion was created using known methods of the day. The initiates, sensitized by their fast and prepared by preceding ceremonies, may have been propelled by the effects of a powerful psychoactive potion into revelatory mind states with profound spiritual and intellectual ramifications.20


While modern scholars have presented evidence supporting their view that a 
potion was drunk as part of the ceremony, the exact composition of that agent remains controversial. Modern preparations of kykeon using ergot-parasitized barley have yielded inconclusive results, although 

Alexander Shulgin
 and 




Ann Shulgin



 describe both 
ergonovine and 
LSA to be known to produce LSD-like effects.2122 








Terence McKenna







 argued that the mysteries were focused around a variety of 
Psilocybe mushrooms, and various other 
entheogenic plants, such as 




Amanita muscaria



 mushrooms, have also been suggested but at present no consensus has been reached.23 The size of the event may rule out 
Amanita or Psilocybe mushrooms as active ingredient, since it is unlikely that there would have been enough wild mushrooms for all participants. However a recent hypothesis suggests that Psilocybe cultivation technology was not unknown in ancient Egypt,24 from which it could easily have spread to Greece.


Another theory is that the kykeon was an 





Ayahuasca




 analog involving 
Syrian Rue (
Peganum harmala), a 
shrub which grows throughout the Mediterranean and also functions as a 
Monoamine oxidase inhibitor. The most likely candidate for the 

DMT
 containing plant, of which there are many in nature, would be a species of 
Acacia.25 Other scholars however, noting the lack of any solid evidence and stressing the collective rather than individual character of initiation into the Mysteries, regard entheogenic theories with pointed skepticism.26

Chinese cooking techniques







Stir frying (  bao) in the wok


Stir frying is an 
umbrella term used to describe two fast 
Chinese cooking techniques: ch o () and bao (). The term stir-fry was introduced into the English language by 










Buwei Yang Chao









, in her book How to Cook and Eat in Chinese, to describe the ch o technique. The two techniques differ in their speed of execution, the amount of heat used, and the amount of tossing done to cook the food in the 
wok. 
Cantonese restaurant patrons judge a chef's ability to perform stir frying by the  
wok hei  produced in the food. This in turn is believed to display their ability to bring out the 
qi of the wok.


Chao technique

 



A product of the ch o ( ) technique



The chao technique is similar to the Western concept of 
braising, itself somewhat different from its Asian counterpart. A traditional round-bottom iron pan called a wok is heated to a high 
temperature. A small amount of 
cooking oil is then poured down the side of the wok (a traditional expression in 
China regarding this is  hot wok, cold oil ), followed by dry 
seasonings (including 
ginger and 
garlic), then at the first moment the seasonings can be smelled, 
meats are added and agitated.  Once the meat is 



seared


, 
vegetables along with liquid ingredients (for example often including premixed combinations of some of soy sauce, vinegar, 
wine, salt, sugar, and cornstarch) are added.  The wok then may be covered for a moment so the water in the liquid ingredients can warm up the new ingredients as it steams off. To keep the meat juicy, usually a cook would take the seared meat out before vegetables are added, and put the meat back right before vegetables are done. In some dishes, or if the cooking conditions are inadequate, different components may be stir fried separately before being combined in the final dish (if, for example, the chef desires the taste of the stir fried vegetables and meats to remain distinct).


The food is stirred and tossed out very quickly using wooden or metal 
cooking utensils.  Some chefs will lift the wok to the side to let the flame light the oil or add a dash of 
wine spirit to give the food extra flavor. Using this method, many dishes can be cooked extremely quickly (within a minute).


Some dishes that require more time are cooked by adding a few dashes of water after the stirring. Then the wok is covered with a lid. As soon as steam starts to come out from under the lid, the dish is ready. In this case, the food is stir fried on high heat for 
flavor and then steamed to ensure that it is fully cooked.




Bao technique


The wok is heated to a dull red glow. With the wok hot, the oil, seasonings and meats are added in rapid succession with no pause in between. The food is continually tossed, stopping for several seconds only to add other ingredients such as various seasonings, broths or vegetables. When the food is deemed to be cooked it is poured and ladled out of the wok. The wok must then be quickly rinsed to prevent food residues from charring and burning to the wok bottom because of residual heat.


The main ingredients are usually cut to smaller pieces to aid in cooking. As well, a larger amount of cooking oil with a high smoke point, such as 
lard and/or 
peanut oil, is often used in bao.

Biology
Physical sciences
Biophysics




Biophysics (also biological physics) is an 
interdisciplinary 
science that employs and develops theories and methods of the 
physical sciences for the investigation of 
biological systems. Studies included under the umbrella of biophysics span all 
levels of biological organization, from the molecular scale to whole organisms and ecosystems. Biophysical research shares significant overlap with 
biochemistry, 
nanotechnology, 
bioengineering and 
systems biology.

Molecular biophysics typically address biological questions that are similar to those in 
biochemistry and 
molecular biology, but the questions are approached quantitatively. Scientists in this field conduct research concerned with understanding the interactions between the various systems of a cell, including the interactions between DNA, RNA and protein biosynthesis, as well as how these interactions are regulated. A great variety of techniques are used to answer these questions.



Fluorescent imaging techniques, as well as 
electron microscopy, 
x-ray crystallography, 
NMR spectroscopy and 
atomic force microscopy (AFM) are often used to visualize structures of biological significance. Direct manipulation of molecules using 
optical tweezers or AFM can also be used to monitor biological events where forces and distances are at the nanoscale. Molecular biophysicists often consider complex biological events as systems of interacting units which can be understood through 
statistical mechanics, 
thermodynamics and 
chemical kinetics. By drawing knowledge and experimental techniques from a wide variety of disciplines, biophysicists are often able to directly observe, model or even manipulate the structures and interactions of individual 
molecules or complexes of molecules.


In addition to traditional (i.e. molecular) biophysical topics like 
structural biology or enzyme 
kinetics, modern biophysics encompasses an extraordinarily broad range of research. It is becoming increasingly common for biophysicists to apply the models and experimental techniques derived from 
physics, as well as 
mathematics and 
statistics, to larger systems such as tissues, organs, 
populations and 
ecosystems.



Focus as a subfield



Biophysics often does not have university-level departments of its own, but has presence as groups across departments within the fields of 
molecular biology, 
biochemistry, 
chemistry, 
computer science, 
mathematics, 
medicine, 
pharmacology, 
physiology, 
physics, and 
neuroscience. What follows is a list of examples of how each department applies its efforts toward the study of biophysics. This list is hardly all inclusive. Nor does each subject of study belong exclusively to any particular department. Each academic institution makes its own rules and there is much overlap between departments.






Biology and 
molecular biology - Almost all forms of biophysics efforts are included in some biology department somewhere. To include some: 
gene regulation, single protein dynamics, bioenergetics, 
patch clamping, 
biomechanics.



Structural biology - Angstrom-resolution structures of proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, carbohydrates, and complexes thereof.



Biochemistry and 
chemistry - biomolecular structure, siRNA, nucleic acid structure, structure-activity relationships.



Computer science - 
Neural networks, biomolecular and drug databases.



Computational chemistry - 
molecular dynamics simulation, 
molecular docking, 
quantum chemistry



Bioinformatics - 
sequence alignment, 
structural alignment, 
protein structure prediction



Mathematics -  graph/network theory, population modeling, dynamical systems, 
phylogenetics.



Medicine and 
neuroscience - tackling neural networks experimentally (brain slicing) as well as theoretically (computer models), membrane permitivity, gene therapy, understanding tumors.



Pharmacology and 
physiology - channel biology, biomolecular interactions, cellular membranes, polyketides.



Physics - biomolecular free energy, stochastic processes, covering dynamics.




Many 
biophysical techniques are unique to this field. Research efforts in biophysics are often initiated by scientists who were traditional physicists, chemists, and biologists by training.

The Quebec Act of 1774 was an 
Act of the 
Parliament of Great Britain (citation 14 Geo. III c. 83) setting procedures of governance in the 
Province of Quebec. 

Principal components of the act:





Expansion of territory to take over part of the 


Indian Reserve (1763)

, including much of what is now southern 

Ontario
, 





Illinois




, 





Indiana




, 

Michigan
, 





Ohio




, 





Wisconsin




 and parts of 





Minnesota




.


Replaced the oath of allegiance so that it no longer made reference to the 


Protestant

 faith.


Guaranteed free practice of the 


Catholic

 faith.


Restored the use of the French 
civil law for private matters while maintaining the use of the English 
common law for public administration, including criminal prosecution.





Background


After the 

Seven Years' War
, a victorious 

Great Britain
 achieved a peace agreement through the 









Treaty of Paris (1763)








. Under the terms of the treaty, the Kingdom of 

France
 chose to keep the islands of 
Guadeloupe and Martinique for their valuable 
sugar production instead of its vast 



North America


n territories east of the 




Mississippi River



 known as 

New France
.  New France was then considered less valuable, as its only significant commercial product at the time was 
beaver 
pelts. The territory located along the 
St. Lawrence River, called Canada by the French, was renamed 
Quebec by the British, after its 

capital city
. 


The Canadians became British subjects, but to be admitted to any public office they were required to swear a test oath, rejecting their Catholic religion.


With unrest growing in the colonies to the south, which would one day grow into the 









American Revolution








, the British were worried that the French Canadians might also support the growing rebellion. At that time, French Canadians formed the vast majority of the population of the province of Quebec (more than 99%) and British immigration was not going well. To secure the allegiance of the approximately 70,000 French Canadians including Cameron and age to the British crown, first Governor 
James Murray and later Governor 

















Guy Carleton
















 promoted the need for action. There was a need to compromise between the conflicting demands of the new subjects and that of the newly arrived British subjects. This eventually resulted in the Quebec Act of 1774.




Effects on the Province of Quebec





Constitution of the Province of Quebec, 1775


The Quebec Act restored the former French civil tradition for 
private law, which had been ended in 1763, and allowed public office holders to practice the 
Roman Catholic faith. It replaced 
the oath to 


Elizabeth I

 and her heirs with one to 


George III

 that had no reference to the 


Protestant

 faith. In other words, for the first time since becoming a British colony, French Canadians were able to participate in the affairs of the colonial government. However, there was no elected legislative assembly; the province was to be governed by an appointed governor and legislative council.1 As a result of this act, the American revolutionaries failed to gain the support of the Canadians during the American Revolution.  Finally, the act annexed to Quebec the area east of the Mississippi River and north of the 



Ohio River


.


The Effects of the Quebec Act2



 Territory : Quebec was expanded to the west to the 




 Upper Mississippi



 and 



Ohio River


. The province was now approximately three times larger than it was originally.


 Government : 


Roman Catholics 

 were now allowed to hold office and there was no elected assembly. Rather than the previous 



Royal Proclamation


 system, Quebec was now governed by a governor and legislative council.


 Law : The traditional French system of private law was restored.


 Religion : The 
tithe (a religious tax) was once again allowed to be collected. Also, the 
 Jesuit priests who had, prior to the Act, had been deported were now allowed to return. 


 Land use system : The Seigneurial System was restored rather than the 
Township System.






 Participation of the Canadians 



The internal communications of the British colonial government at Quebec suggest a relative failure of the purpose of the Quebec Act. On 
4 February 
1775 Governor Guy Carleton writes to General 


Thomas Gage

 that he believes the Canadians to be generally happy with the act, yet he also adds:


[...] I must not however conceal from Your Excellency, that the Gentry, well disposed, and heartily desirous as they are, to serve the Crown, and to serve it with Zeal, when formed into regular Corps, do not relish commanding a bare Militia, they never were used to that Service under the French Government, (and perhaps for good Reasons) besides the sudden Dismission of the Canadian Regiment raised in 1764, without Gratuity or Recompence to Offices, who engaged in our Service almost immediately after the Cession of the Country, of taking any Notice of them since, tho' they all expected half pay, is still uppermost in their Thoughts, and not likely to encourage their engaging a second Time in the same Way; as to the Habitants or Peasantry, ever since the Civil Authority has been introduced into the Province, the Government of it has hung so loose, and retained so little Power, they have in a Manner emancipated themselves, and it will require Time, and discreet Management likewise, to recall them to their ancient Habits of Obedience and Discipline; considering all the new Ideas they have been acquiring for these ten years past, can it be thought they will be pleased at being suddenly, and without Preparation embodied into a Militia, and marched from their Families, Lands, and Habitations to remote Provinces, and all the Horrors of War, which they have already experienced; It would give appearance of Truth to the Language of our Sons of Sedition, at this very Moment busily employed instilling into their Minds, that the Act was passed merely to serve the present Purposes of Government, and in the full Intention of ruling over them with all the Despotism of their ancient Masters. 3


In the same communication, the temporary and circumstantial nature of the act is hinted to when he writes:


[...] It may be further observed, that the Act is no more than the Foundation of future Establishments; that the new Commissions and Instructions, expected out, are not yet arrived, and that the Dissolution of the present Constitution, if it deserves the Name, and Establishment of the new one, are still at some Distance; 4


About 4 months later, Carleton's apprehensions regarding the ability of the Canadian noblesse (nobility) and clergy to rule over the people are proved right. On June 7, he writes to Colonial Secretary 












Dartmouth











:


My Lord! The 19th of last Month in the Evening, I received Intelligence from General Gage by Sea of the Rebels having commenced Hostilities in the Province of the Massachusetts, and Requesting I would send the 7th Regiment with some Companies of Canadians and Indians to Crown Point, in order to make a Diversion, and favour his Operations. [...] 5


The little Force we have in the Province was immediately set in Motion, and ordered to assemble at or near St. John's; The Noblesse of this Neighbourhood were called upon to collect their Inhabitants, in order to defend themselves, the Savages of those Parts likewise had the same orders; but tho' the Gentlemen testified great Zeal, neither their Entreaties or their Example could prevail upon the People; a few of the Gentry, consisting principally of the Youth, residing in this Place, and its Neighbourhood, formed a small Corps of Volunteers under the Command of Mr. Samuel Mackay, and took Post at St. John's; the Indians shewed as much Backwardness as the Canadian Peasantry. [...] 6


Less than a month later, on 
June 28, 
1775, Chief Justice 
William Hey writes to the Lord Chancellor from Quebec:


[...] What will be your Lordships astonishment when I tell you that an act passed for the express purpose of gratifying the Canadians   which was supposed to comprehend all that they either wished or wanted is become the first object of their discontent   dislike. English officers to command them in time of war,   English Laws to govern them in time of Peace, is the general wish. the former they know to be impossible (at least at present)   by the latter if I understand them right, they mean no Laws   no Government whatsoever - in the mean time it may be truly said that Gen. Carleton had taken an ill measure of the influence of the seigneurs   Clergy over the lower order of people whose Principle of conduct founded in fear   the sharpness of authority over them now no longer exercised, is unrestrained,   breaks out in every shape of contempt or detestation of those whom they used to behold with terror   who gave them I believe too many occasions to express it. And the on their parts have been and are too much elated with the advantages they supposed they should derive from the restoration of their old Privileges   customs,   indulged themselves in a way of thinking   talking that gave very just offence, as well to their own People as to the English merchants. 7


On 
September 21, 
1775, Lieutenant-Governor 
Cramahe, who replaces Carleton at Quebec, writes to Dartmouth on the failure to rally the people:


My Lord !


I am sorry to transmit to Your Lordship the disagreeable account of a disagreeable Business, some time in the Beginning of this Month, upon news of the Rebel Army approaching, General Carleton set out for Montreal in great Haste; the 7th instant the Rebels landed in the Woods near St. John's, and beat back to their Boats by a Party of Savages incamped at that Place; in this Action the Savages behaved with great Spirit and Resolution, and had they remained firm to our Interests, probably the Province would have been safe for this Year, but finding the Canadians in General averse to the taking up Arms for the Defence of their Country, they withdrew, and made their Peace.


After their Defeat the Rebels retired to the Isle aux Noix, where they continued till lately, sending out some Parties, and many Emissaries, to debauch the Minds of the Canadians and Indians, in which they have proved too successful, and for which they were too well prepared by the Cabals and Intrigues of these two last years; We knew of their being reinforced, and very considerably, I suppose, as they appeared in Numbers near St. John's last Sunday Evening; where or when they landed, or the Particulars since, we have but very imperfect Accounts of, all Communications with the Forts of St. John's and Chambli, being, as far as I can find, entirely cut off.


No Means have been left untried to bring the Canadian Peasantry to a Sense of their Duty, and engage them to take up arms in Defence of the Province, but all to no Purpose. The Justice must be done to the Gentry, Clergy, and most of the Bourgeoisie, that they have shewen the greatest Zeal and Fidelity to the King's Service, and exerted their best endeavours to reclaim their infatuated Countrymen; [...]8





Effect on the Thirteen Colonies


While it is clear that the Quebec Act did much to secure the allegiance of the 
Canadians to Britain, it had other unforeseen consequences. It was termed one of the 



Intolerable Acts


 by the American colonists, further contributing to the American Revolution.


American colonists had concerns with the provisions of the act. For one, it guaranteed that residents of the 


Ohio Country

 were free to profess the Roman Catholic faith. Settlers from 

Virginia
 and other colonies were already entering that area. Land development companies had already been formed to drive out the 

Native inhabitants
 and exploit the territory. Many of the leaders of the American Revolution, such as 





George Washington




 and 

Daniel Boone
, were wealthy land speculators who had much to gain by establishing a new government that would not be bound by British treaties with the 

Indians
, such as the 
Proclamation of 1763, that recognized Indian rights to these lands.
http://www.wvculture.org/hiStory/indland.html Americans denounced the Act for promoting the growth of papism and cutting back on freedom and traditional rights.  In particular, the colonial governments of New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia were angered by the unilateral assignment of the Ohio River lands to Quebec, and not to themselves as their royal charters specified.


Langston (2006) looked at press reaction in New England. Some colonial editors explained their views on how it reorganized Canadian governance, explaining how they felt it established direct rule by the Crown and limiting the reach of English law to criminal jurisprudence. 











Isaiah Thomas










 of the 
Massachusetts Spy drew links between the Quebec Act and legislation circumscribing American liberties, such as the 








Tea Act







 and the 
Coercive Acts. Editors shaped public opinion by writing 
editorials and reprinting opposition letters from both sides of the Atlantic. The 
First Continental Congress, which met from 5 September to 26 October 1774, addressed the inhabitants of Quebec, warning them of the perils of the increasingly arbitrary, tyrannical, and oppressive nature of British government.


The Act was never enforced outside Canada. Its main significance in the 




Thirteen Colonies



 was that it angered the rebels, weakened the Crown's supporters (






Loyalists





), and helped to accelerate the confrontation that became the 









American Revolution








 (Miller 1943). The Act is listed as one of the rebels' grievances in the 

Declaration of Independence
.  When the war started, the 
British Parliament made an unsuccessful effort to repeal the laws in hopes of mollifying the angry colonists, but it did not work.




Footnotes





The appointed council was temporary, and composed of residents of the Province. Article XII, providing for an appointed Legislative Council, was repealed by the 





Constitutional Act of 1791

Courtroom dramas
Film genres
Legal genre of fiction
Drama




A legal drama is a work of dramatic 
fiction about crime and civil litigation. Subtypes of legal dramas include courtroom dramas and legal thrillers, and come in all forms, including 
novels, 
television shows, and 
films. Legal drama sometimes overlap with crime drama, most notably in the case of 

Law   Order
. Most crime drama focus on crime investigation and does not feature court room. 

It is widely believed by most practicing 
lawyers that legal dramas result in the general public having misconceptions about the legal process.  Many of these misconceptions result from the desire to create an interesting story.  For example, conflict between parties make for an interesting story, which is why legal dramas emphasize the 
trial and ignore the fact that the vast majority of 
civil and 
criminal cases in the 








United States







 are settled out of court.  Legal dramas also focus on situations where there is an obvious injustice or ones in which either the 
plaintiff or 
defendant is very interesting and unusual.  As a result, things such as the 
insanity defense occur far more often in legal drama than in real life.  Finally, legal dramas often focus on  areas of the legal process which can be portrayed dramatically, such as 
oral arguments, and ignore areas which are less easily portrayed, such as researching a written legal brief.

Stephen Reeder Donaldson

May 13, 1947 (1947-05-13) (age 61)





Stephen Reeder Donaldson (born 
May 13, 
1947 in 
Cleveland, Ohio) is an 








American







 
fantasy, 
science fiction and 
mystery 
novelist. He earned his 
bachelor's degree from 

The College of Wooster
 and 
master's degree from 

Kent State University
.  He currently resides in 





New Mexico




.


In the 











United Kingdom










 he is usually called  Stephen Donaldson  (without the  R ).



Major Influences


Donaldson is part of the generation of fantasy authors which came to prominence in the 1970s and early 1980s. Like that of many of his peers, his writing is heavily influenced by the works of 


J. R. R. Tolkien

. However, Donaldson's stories show a wide range of other influences, including 

Mervyn Peake
, 




C. S. Lewis



, 


Robert E. Howard

, and even the operas of 

Richard Wagner
. Donaldson is also a great fan of 

Roger Zelazny
's 
Amber novels, which were a direct inspiration for his own 





Mordant's Need




 series. Also, in the Gradual Interview section of his website, Donaldson mentions his extensive study of 


Joseph Conrad

, 



Henry James


 and 

William Faulkner
 to further develop his narrative style.




The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, the Unbeliever





Main article: 









The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, the Unbeliever











Donaldson's most celebrated series is 









The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, the Unbeliever








, which centers on a cynical 
leper, shunned by society, who is destined to become the heroic savior of an alternate Earth. Covenant struggles against the tyrannical 
Lord Foul, who intends to break the physical universe in order to escape his bondage and wreak revenge upon his arch-enemy,  The Creator .


The Chronicles were originally published as two trilogies of novels between 1977 and 1983. According to his current publisher, Putnams, those two series sold more than 10 million copies. A third series,  The Last Chronicles of Thomas Covenant  began publication in 2004 with the novel  The Runes of The Earth.    With the second book of that series,  Fatal Revenant,  Donaldson again attained bestseller status when the book reached number 12 on the New York Times Bestseller List in October of 2007.

The Gap Cycle


A 
science fiction epic set in a future where humans have pushed far out into space in the attempt to replace depleted resources, 





The Gap Cycle




 follows two concurrent story arcs. The first concerns an ensign in the United Mining Companies Police (UMCP), 
Morn Hyland, who is attempting simply to stay alive after being captured by a marauder named 
Angus Thermopyle. The second follows the Byzantine political maneuvering of the head of the UMCP, 
Warden Dios, as he attempts to thwart the machinations of his boss, 
Holt Fasner, who is the CEO of United Mining Companies (UMC) and the most powerful man in human space. 


Each of the epics takes place against the backdrop of a threat to human survival itself from an alien species called the 
Amnion who use genetic mutation as a way to assimilate and overcome. Trade in raw materials (mostly ores) is carried out with the Amnion in exchange for technology, by both the UMC and illegals. Some illegals trade in Amnion territorial space, referred to as  forbidden space , out of bounds to the UMCP by treaty.


Donaldson wrote the series in part to be a reworking of 
Wagner's 
Ring Cycle. The  Gap  of the title refers to the 


FTL

 (faster than light) drives used by the space vessels in order to cross great distances, an instantaneous occurrence similar to the notion of  folding  space.

Geography of Bhutan







Topographic map of Bhutan



The 

Kingdom of Bhutan
 is a 


Himalayan

 
nation, located towards the eastern extreme of the aforementioned 
mountain range. It is fairly evenly sandwiched between the sovereign territory of two nations: first, the 

People's Republic of China
 on the north and northwest. There are approximately 470 kilometers of border with that nation's 

Tibet Autonomous Region
. The second nation is the 

Republic of India
 on the south, southwest, and east; there are approximately 605 kilometers with the states of 

Arunachal Pradesh
, 





Assam




, 






West Bengal





, and 





Sikkim




, in clockwise order from the kingdom. Bhutan's total borders amount to 1,075 kilometers. The 

Kingdom of Nepal
 to the west, the 

People's Republic of Bangladesh
 to the south, and the 
Union of Myanmar to the southeast are other close neighbours; the former two are separated by only very small stretches of Indian territory.

Bhutan is a very compact nation, but with just a small bit more 
length than 
width. The nation's territory totals an approximate 46,500 square kilometres. Because of its inland, 
landlocked status, it controls no 
territorial waters. Its shape, area, and mountainous location are comparable to that of 

Switzerland
.It is now popularly known as Switzerland of Asia. Bhutan's territory used to extend south into present-day Assam, including the 
protectorate of 

Cooch Behar
, but, starting in 
1772, the 
British East India Company began to push back the borders through a number of wars and treaties, severely reducing Bhutan's size until the Treaty of Sinchulu of 
1865, when some border land was ceded back.

Bhutan's towns and villages





Bhutan is divided into 20 
dzongkhag, and further into 201 
gewog.




Natural Geography





Gangkhar Puensum from Ura La, Bhutan


The 


Himalayas

 dominate the north of the country, where mountain peaks can easily reach seven thousand meters; the highest point is claimed to be the 

Kula Kangri
, at 7 553 m, but detailed topographic studies claim 

Kula Kangri
 is wholly in 





Tibet




 and modern Chinese measurements claim that 

Gangkhar Puensum
, which has the distinction of being the 
highest unclimbed mountain in the world, is higher at 7 570 m (vs 7 538 m for Kula Kangri). Weather is extreme in the mountains: the high peaks have perpetual snow, and the lesser mountains and hewn gorges have high winds all year round, making them barren brown wind tunnels in summer, and frozen wastelands in winter. The 
blizzards generated in the north each 
winter often drift southward into the central 
highlands.


The highlands are the most populous part of the nation; the 
capital of 

Thimphu
 lies in the western region. The region is characterized by its many 
rivers (flowing into 

India
's 
Brahmaputra), its isolated valleys that house most of the population, and the expansive forests that cover seventy percent of the nation. Winters are cold, summer are hot; the rainy season is accompanied with frequented landslides.


The valleys of Bhutan are linked by a series of passes ( La  in 
Dzongkha).  Between the 
Haa valley and 
Paro Valley is the 
Chele La (3780m).  The Chele La is the highest pass crossed by a Bhutanese highway.  The Lateral Road from Thimphu to 








Punakha







 crosses the 
Dochu La (3116m), which features 108 
chortens built to commemorate the expulsion of Assamese guerrillas.   East of 

Wangdue Phodrang
 is the 
Pele La (3390m). Continuing to the east along the main highway, other major passes include the 
Yotang La, 
Shertang La, 
Wangthang La, 
Thrumsing La and 
Kori La (2298m). 


The extreme southern strip of the nation consists mostly of tropical plains, more typical of India. It is largely agricultural land, producing mostly 
rice. Only two percent of Bhutan is 
arable land, with most of it focused here.


Centuries of 
isolationism, a small 
population, and topographical extremes have led to Bhutan maintaining one of the most intact 
ecosystems in the world. The country ranks amongst the top ten countries in the world in terms of species density (species richness per unit area). Over fifty-five hundred varieties of plantlife exist, including around three-hundred medicinal ones. More than 770 species of avifauna and more than 165 species of mammals are known to exist, including many rare and endangered species like the 
red panda, 
snow leopard, and 
golden langur.




Strategic Location


Bhutan, situated between 

India
 and Chinese-occupied 





Tibet




, is a potential 
Sino-Indian battleground; India currently has more political influence in the nation. This stems from two things: the fact that after the British granted sovereignty to their 


South Asia

n possessions, Bhutan, a 
protectorate, was briefly put under the administration of 

India
, along with 





Sikkim




. 
Independence occurred quickly, but India maintained a special treaty relationship with the now-sovereign 
monarchy.  The 
Indian Army patrols Bhutan's frontiers and has played a major role in the development of the country's road infrastructure.  Additionally, the 
Government of India continues to provide approximately 60% of Bhutan's government finances.


The second reason comes from the aggression against 





Tibet




 by 
China from 
1949 to 
1959; the 

Tibetans
 have strong cultural, historical, and religious connections to Bhutan.


Bhutan controls several strategic mountain passes through the 


Himalayas

, allowing travel between Tibet and 





Assam




. These passes are also the only way into the kingdom, and, coupled with its centuries-old policies of 
isolationism, it has been called the  Mountain Fortress of the Gods.  The heartland of Bhutan has never been successfully invaded; the 











British










, while establishing a protectorate over the nation, did so with threats to the low-lying territories below the highlands.




Climate


Bhutan's climate is as varied as its altitudes and, like most of Asia, is affected by monsoons. Western Bhutan is particularly affected by monsoons that bring between 60 and 90 percent of the region's rainfall. The climate is humid and subtropical in the southern plains and foothills, temperate in the inner Himalayan valleys of the southern and central regions, and cold in the north, with year-round snow on the main Himalayan summits.


Temperatures vary according to elevation. Temperatures in Thimphu, located at 2,200 meters above sea level in west-central Bhutan, range from approximately 15 C to 26 C during the monsoon season of June through September but drop to between about -4 C and 16 C in January. Most of the central portion of the country experiences a cool, temperate climate year-round. In the south, a hot, humid climate helps maintain a fairly even temperature range of between 15 C and 30 C year-round, although temperatures sometimes reach 40 C in the valleys during the summer.


Annual precipitation ranges widely in various parts of the country. In the severe climate of the north, there is only about forty millimeters of annual precipitation--primarily snow. In the temperate central regions, a yearly average of around 1,000 millimeters is more common, and 7,800 millimeters per year has been registered at some locations in the humid, subtropical south, ensuring the thick tropical forest, or savanna. Thimphu experiences dry winter months (December through February) and almost no precipitation until March, when rainfall averages 20 millimeters a month and increases steadily thereafter to a high of 220 millimeters in August for a total annual rainfall of nearly 650 millimeters.


Bhutan's generally dry spring starts in early March and lasts until mid-April. Summer weather commences in mid-April with occasional showers and continues through the premonsoon rains of late June. The summer monsoon lasts from late June through late September with heavy rains from the southwest. The monsoon weather, blocked from its northward progress by the Himalayas, brings heavy rains, high humidity, flash floods and landslides, and numerous misty, overcast days. Autumn, from late September or early October to late November, follows the rainy season. It is characterized by bright, sunny days and some early snowfalls at higher elevations. From late November until March, winter sets in, with frost throughout much of the country and snowfall common above elevations of 3,000 meters. The winter northeast monsoon brings gale-force winds down through high mountain passes, giving Bhutan its name-- Drukyul, which in the Dzongkha language mean Land of the Thunder Dragon.




River systems





This image shows the termini of the glaciers in the Bhutan-Himalaya. Glacial lakes have been rapidly forming on the surface of the debris-covered glaciers in this region during the last few decades.



Glacial lakes have been rapidly forming on the surface of the debris-covered glaciers in this region during the last few decades.
Bhutan has four major river systems: the 



Drangme Chhu


; the 
Puna Tsang Chhu, also called the 
Sankosh; the 
Wang Chhu; and the 
Amo Chhu. Each flows swiftly out of the 
Himalayas, southerly through the 
Dooars to join the 



Brahmaputra River


 in 

India
, and thence through 

Bangladesh
 where the 
Brahmaputra (or 
Jamuna in Bangladesh) joins the mighty 



Ganges


 (or Padma in Bangladesh) to flow into the 

Bay of Bengal
. The largest river system, the Drangme Chhu, flows southwesterly from India's state of 

Arunachal Pradesh
 and has three major branches: the 



Drangme Chhu


, 



Mangde Chhu


, and 
Bumthang Chhu. These branches form the Drangme Chhu basin, which spreads over most of eastern Bhutan and drains the 
Tongsa and 
Bumthang valleys. In the Duars, where eight tributaries join it, the Drangme Chhu is called the 
Manas Chhu. The 320-kilometer-long 
Puna Tsang Chhu rises in northwestern Bhutan as the 



Mo Chhu


 and 
Pho Chhu, which are fed by the snows from the Great Himalayan Range. They flow southerly to 








Punakha







, where they join to form the 
Puna Tsang Chhu, which flows southerly into India's state of 






West Bengal





. The tributaries of the 370-kilometer-long 
Wang Chhu rise in 





Tibet




. The Wang Chhu itself flows southeasterly through west-central Bhutan, drains the Ha, Paro, and Thimphu valleys, and continues into the Duars, where it enters West Bengal as the 
Raigye Chhu. The smallest river system, the 
Torsa Chhu, known as the 
Amo Chhu in its northern reaches, also flows out of Tibet into the 





Chumbi Valley




 and swiftly through western Bhutan before broadening near 

Phuntsholing
 and then flowing into India.




Glaciers


Glaciers in northern Bhutan, which cover about 10 percent of the total surface area, are an important renewable source of water for Bhutan's rivers. Fed by fresh snow each winter and slow melting in the summer, the glaciers bring millions of liters of fresh water to Bhutan and downriver areas each year. Glacial melt added to monsoon-swollen rivers, however, also contributes to flooding.   Where glacial movement temporary blocks riverflows, downstream areas may be threatened by jokulhlaups(
GLOF).

Chua  (






Timucua





n word for  sinkhole )




Alachua County is a 
county located in the 








U.S. state







 of 

Florida
.  The 

U.S. Census Bureau
 2006 estimate for the county is 227,120.1 Its 
county seat is 

Gainesville
, 

Florida
2. Alachua County is the home of the 


University of Florida

, but it is also known for its diverse culture, local music, and artisans. Much of its economy revolves around the university however. 


 History 


The Alachua area appears to have been the first area occupied by the immigrant 
Oconees, the original 

Seminole
s, about 1740.  Their first town was situated on or near the old Alachua plain, now called 
Payne's Prairie in homage to 




 King  Payne



, chief of the Alachua settlements upon his death in 1812.


The meaning of Alachua is suggested by a passage in the journal of Lieutenant Diego Pena, who on his expedition to 







Apalachee






 and 
Apalachicola in 1716, traversed the region, and of the area between the 



Ichetucknee


 and 

Suwannee River
s in southern 
Suwannee County remarks:






 

The 21st day I left the said site (adjacent to the Itchtucknee River) and camped at a place they call Aquilachua this day I marched five leagues.  In this day's march no creeks were encountered but there are good springs of water, and the first (is) named Usichua, (and) the other Usiparachua, and another Afanochua.

 





That the springs without effluent streams were 
sinkholes is consistent with the area, which has many.  The names of these watering places all possess the terminator chua, which suggests that chua is the 






Timucua





n name for sinkhole.  This inference is not inconsistent with the general opinion of residents of the county, that the name Alachua means sinkhole.3


Alachua County proper was created in 1824.  The original 
county seat was 











Newnansville










 located near the current site of the city of 

Alachua
. In 1853, the new railroad from 

Fernandina
 to 

Cedar Key
 bypassed Newnansville, and Gainesville, a new town that was located on the railroad, began to draw business and residents away from Newnansville. Gainesville became the county seat the following year.4




Geography


According to the 

U.S. Census Bureau
, the county has a total area of 969.12 square miles (2,510.0 km2).  874.25 square miles (2,264.3 km2) of it is land and 94.94 square miles (245.9 km2) of it (9.79%) is water. Alachua County is part of the 



Gainesville Metropolitan Statistical Area

Common disk-shaped tablets



A tablet is a mixture of active substances and 
excipients, usually in 



powder


 form, pressed or compacted into a solid. The excipients include binders, glidants (flow aids) and lubricants to ensure efficient tabletting; disintegrants to ensure that the tablet breaks up in the digestive tract; sweeteners or flavours to mask the taste of bad-tasting active ingredients; and pigments to make uncoated tablets visually attractive. A coating may be applied to hide the taste of the tablet's components, to make the tablet smoother and easier to swallow, and to make it more resistant to the environment, extending its shelf life.


The compressed 
tablet is the most popular 


dosage

 form in use today. About two-thirds of all 
prescriptions are dispensed as solid dosage forms, and half of these are compressed tablets. A tablet can be formulated to deliver an accurate dosage to a specific site; it is usually taken orally, but can be administered 
sublingually, 
rectally or 
intravaginally. Tablet formation represents the last stage in down-stream processing within the 
pharmaceutical industry. It is just one of the many forms that an oral drug can take such as 
syrups, 
elixirs, 
suspensions, and 
emulsions. It consists of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (A.P.I.) with biologically inert excipients in a 
compressed, solid form.


Medicinal tablets were originally made in the shape of a disk of whatever color their components determined, but are now made in many shapes and colors to help users to distinguish between different medicines that they take. Tablets are often stamped with symbols, letters, and numbers, which enable them to be identified. Sizes of tablets to be swallowed range from a few millimeters to about a centimeter. Some tablets are in the shape of 
capsules, and are called  caplets .



Medicines to be taken orally are very often supplied in tablet form; indeed the word tablet without qualification would be taken to refer to a medicinal tablet. Medicinal tablets and 
capsules are often called pills. Other products are manufactured in the form of tablets which are designed to dissolve or disintegrate; e.g. cleaning and deodorizing products.



Tabletting formulations






Capping (top) and lamination (right) tablet failure modes


 In the tablet-pressing process, it is important that all ingredients be fairly dry, powdered or granular, somewhat uniform in particle size, and freely flowing. Mixed particle sized powders can segregate due to operational vibrations, which can result in tablets with poor drug or active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) content uniformity. Content uniformity ensures that the same API dose is delivered with each tablet.


Some APIs may be tableted as pure substances, but this is rarely the case; most formulations include 
excipients. Normally, an inactive ingredient (excipient) termed a binder is added to help hold the tablet together and give it strength. A wide variety of binders may be used, some common ones including 
lactose powder, dibasic calcium phosphate, 
sucrose, corn (maize) starch, microcrystalline 
cellulose and modified cellulose (for example hydroxymethyl cellulose).


Often, an ingredient is also needed to act as a disintegrant that hydrates readily in water to aid tablet dispersion once swallowed, releasing the API for absorption. Some binders, such as starch and cellulose, are also excellent disintegrants.


Small amounts of lubricants are usually added, as well. The most common of these is magnesium stearate; however, other commonly used tablet lubricants include 
stearic acid (stearin), hydrogenated oil, and sodium stearyl fumarate. These help the tablets, once pressed, to be more easily ejected from the die.



Friability is an important factor in tablet formulation to ensure that the tablet can stay intact and withhold its form from any outside force of pressure:


%friability=100 \times \dfrac{(W_o - W_f)}{W_o}


where Wo is the original 
weight of the tablets, and Wf is the final weight of the tablets after the collection is put through the 
friabilator.  


Friability below 0.8% is usually considered satisfactory.




Advantages and disadvantages



Tablets are easy and convenient to use. They provide an accurately measured dosage in a convenient portable package, and can be designed to protect unstable medications or disguise unpalatable ingredients. Coatings can be coloured or stamped to aid tablet recognition. Manufacturing processes and techniques can provide tablets special properties; for example enteric coatings or sustained release formulations.


Tablets cannot be used adequately in case of emergency cases. This is because the rate at which the active ingredient reaches the site to be treated is slow. Other means such intravenous and intramuscular injections are more effective. 
Some drugs may be unsuitable for administration by the oral route. For example protein drugs such as insulin may be denatured by stomach acids. Such drugs cannot be made into tablets. Some drugs may be deactivated by the 
liver (the  first pass effect ) making them unsuitable for oral use. Drugs which can be taken sublingually bypass the liver and are less susceptible to the first pass effect. Bioavailability of some drugs may be low due to poor absorption from the gastric tract. Such drugs may need to be given in very high doses or by injection. For drugs that need to have rapid onset, or that have severe side effects, the oral route may not be suitable. For example 

Salbutamol
, used to treat problems in the pulmonary system, can have effects on the heart and circulation if taken orally; these effects are greatly reduced by inhaling smaller doses direct to the required site of action.




Tablet properties


Tablets can be made in virtually any shape, although requirements of patients and tabletting machines mean that most are round, oval or capsule shaped. More unsusual shapes have been manufactured but patients find these harder to swallow, and they are more vulnerable to chipping or manufacturing problems.


Tablet diameter and shape are determined a combination of a set of punches and a die. This is called a station of tooling. The thickness is determined by the amount of tablet material and the position of the punches in relation to each other during compression. Once this is done, we can measure the corresponding pressure applied during compression. The shorter the distance between the punches, thickness, the greater the pressure applied during compression, and sometimes the harder the tablet. Tablets need to be hard enough that they don't break up in the bottle, yet friable enough that they disintegrate in the gastric tract. 


The tablet is composed of the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (that is the active drug) together with various excipients. These are biologically inert ingredients which either enhance the therapeutic effect or are necessary to construct the tablet. The filler or diluent (e.g. 
lactose or 
sorbitol)is a bulking agent, providing a quantity of material which can accurately be formed into a tablet. Binders (e.g. methyl cellulose or gelatin) hold the ingredients together so that they can form a tablet. Lubricants (e.g. magnesium stearate or 
polyethylene glycol) are added to reduce the friction between the tablet and the punches and dies so that the tablet compression and ejection processes are smooth. Disintegrants (e.g. 
starch or 
cellulose) are used to promote wetting and swelling of the tablet so that it breaks up in the gastro intestinal tract; this is necessary to ensure dissolution of the API. Superdisintegrants are sometimes used to greatly speed up the disintegration of the tablet. Additional ingredients may also be added such as coloring agents, flavoring agents, and coating agents. Formulations are designed using small quantities in a laboratory machine called a Powder Compaction Simulator. This can prove the manufacturing process and provide information for the regulatory authorities.




Manufacturing


In the tablet-pressing process, it is important that all ingredients be dry, powdered, and of uniform grain size as much as possible. The main guideline in 
manufacture is to ensure that the appropriate amount of active ingredient is equal in each tablet so ingredients should be well-mixed. Compressed tablets are exerted to great pressure in order to compact the material. If a sufficiently homogenous mix of the components cannot be obtained with simple mixing, the ingredients must be granulated prior to compression to assure an even distribution of the active compound in the final tablet. Two basic techniques are used to prepare powders for granulation into a tablet: wet granulation and dry granulation.


Powders that can be mixed well do not require granulation and can be compressed into tablets through Direct Compression



Direct Compression


This method is used when a group of ingredients can be blended and placed in a tablet press to make a tablet without any of the ingredients having to be changed. This is not very common because many tablets have active pharmaceutical ingredients which will not allow for direct compression due to their concentration or the excipients used in formulation are not conducive to direct compression.



Granulation is the process of collecting particles together by creating bonds between them. There are several different methods of granulation. The most popular, which is used by over 70% of formulation in tablet manufacture is wet granulation. Dry granulation is another method used to form granules.




Wet granulation


Wet granulation is a process of using a liquid binder or adhesive to the powder mixture. The amount of 
liquid can be properly managed, and over wetting will cause the granules to be too hard and under wetting will cause the granules to be too soft and friable. Aqueous solutions have the advantage of being safer to deal with than solvents.  



Procedure of Wet Granulation


 Step 1: Weighing and Blending - the active ingredient, filler, disintegration agents, are weighed and mixed.


 Step 2: The wet granulate is prepared by adding the liquid binder/adhesive. Examples of binders/adhesives include aqueous preparations of cornstarch, natural gums such as acacia, cellulose derivatives such as methyl cellulose, CMC, 
gelatin, and povidone. Ingredients are placed within a granulator which helps ensure correct 
density of the composition.


 Step 3: Screening the damp mass into pellets or granules


 Step 4: Drying the granulation


 Step 5: Dry screening: After the granules are dried, pass through a screen of smaller size than the one used for the wet mass to select granules of uniform size to allow even fill in the die cavity


 Step 6: 
Lubrication- A dry lubricant, antiadherent and glidant are added to the granules either by dusting over the spread-out granules or by blending with the granules. Its reduces friction between the tablet and the walls of the die cavity. Antiadherent reduces sticking of the tablet to the die and punch.


 Step 7: Tableting: Last step in which the tablet is fed into the die cavity and then compressed between a lower and an upper punch.




Water may be used as the liquid binder, but sometimes many actives are not compatible with water. Water mixed into the powder can form bonds between powder particles that are strong enough to lock them in together. However, once the water dries, the powders may fall apart and therefore might not be strong enough to create and hold a bond.  
Povidone also known as polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) is one of the most commonly used pharmaceutical binders. PVP and a solvent are mixed with the powders to form a bond during the process, and the solvent evaporates. Once the solvent evaporates and powders have formed a densely held mass, then the granulation is milled which results in formation of granules




Dry granulation


This process is used when the product needed to be granulated may be sensitive to moisture and heat. Dry granulation can be conducted on a press using slugging tooling or on a roller compactor commonly referred to as a 
chilsonator. Dry granulation equipment offers a wide range of pressure and roll types to attain proper densification. However, the process may require repeated compaction steps to attain the proper granule end point.  


Process times are often reduced and equipment requirements are streamlined; therefore the cost is reduced. However, dry granulation often produces a higher percentage of fines or noncompacted products, which could compromise the quality or create yield problems for the tablet. It requires drugs or excipients with cohesive properties.





 Some granular chemicals are suitable for direct compression (free flowing) e.g. 
potassium chloride.


 Tableting excipients with good flow characteristics and compressibility allow for direct compression of a variety of drugs.






Fluidized bed granulation


It is a multiple step process performed in the same vessel to pre-heat, granulate and dry the powders. It is today a commonly used method in pharmaceuticals because it allows the individual company to more fully control the powder preparation process. It requires only one piece of machinery that mixes all the powders and granules on a bed of air.





Tablet Compaction Simulator


Tablet formulations are designed and tested using a laboratory machine called a Tablet Compaction Simulator or Powder Compaction Simulator. This is a computer controlled device that can measure the punch positions, punch pressures, friction forces, die wall pressures, and sometimes the tablet internal temperature during the compaction event. Numerous experiments with small quantities of different mixtures can be performed to optimise a formulation.
Mathematically corrected punch motions can be programmed to simulate any type and model of production tablet press. Small differences in production machine stiffness can change the strain rate during compaction by large amounts, affecting temperature and compaction behaviour. To simulate true production conditions in today's high speed tablet presses, modern Compaction Simulators are very powerful and strong.


Initial quantities of active pharmaceutical ingredients are very expensive to produce, and using a Compaction Simulator reduces the amount of powder required for development.


Load controlled tests are particularly useful for designing multi-layer tablets where layer interface conditions must be studied.


Test data recorded by the Simulators must meet the regulations for security, completeness and quality to support new or modified drug filings, and show that the designed manufacturing process is robust and reliable.




Tablet coating


Many tablets today are coated after being pressed. Although sugar-coating was popular in the past, the process has many drawbacks. Modern tablet coatings are 
polymer and 
polysaccharide based, with 
plasticizers and 
pigments included. Tablet coatings must be stable and strong enough to survive the handling of the tablet, must not make tablets stick together during the coating process, and must follow the fine contours of embossed characters or logos on tablets. Coatings can also facilitate printing on tablets, if required. Coatings are necessary for tablets that have an unpleasant taste, and a smoother finish makes large tablets easier to swallow. Tablet coatings are also useful to extend the shelf-life of components that are sensitive to moisture or oxidation. Opaque materials like 
titanium dioxide can protect light-sensitive actives from 
photodegradation. Special coatings (for example with pearlescent effects) can enhance brand recognition.


If the active ingredient of a tablet is sensitive to acid, or is irritant to the stomach lining, an 
enteric coating can be used, which is resistant to 
stomach acid and dissolves in the high pH of the intestines. Enteric coatings are also used for medicines that can be negatively affected by taking a long time to reach the 
small intestine where they are absorbed. Coatings are often chosen to control the rate of dissolution of the drug in the gastro-intestinal tract. Some drugs will be absorbed better at different points in the digestive system. If the highest percentage of absorption of a drug takes place in the stomach, a coating that dissolves quickly and easily in acid will be selected. If the rate of absorption is best in the large intestine or colon, then a coating that is acid resistant and dissolves slowly would be used to ensure it reached that point before dispersing. The area of the gastro-intestinal tract with the best absorption for any particular drug is usually determined by clinical trials.


This is the last stage in tablet formulation and it is done to protect the tablet from 
temperature and 
humidity constraints. It is also done to mask the 
taste, give it special characteristics, distinction to the product, and prevent inadvertent contact with the drug substance. The most common forms of tablet coating are sugar coating and film coating.


Coating is also performed for the following reasons:



Controlling site of drug release


Providing controlled, continuous release or reduce the frequency of drug dosing


Maintaining physical or chemical drug integrity


Enhancing product acceptance and appearance





Sugar coating is done by rolling the tablets in heavy 
syrup, in a similar process to 
candy making. It is done to give tablets an attractive appearance and to make pill-taking less unpleasant. However, the process is tedious and time-consuming and it requires the expertise of highly skilled 
technician. It also adds a substantial amount of weight to the tablet which can create some problems in packaging and 
distribution.


In comparison to sugar coating, film coating is more durable, less bulky, and less time consuming. But it creates more difficulty in hiding tablet appearance. One application of film-coating is for enteric protection, termed enteric coating. The purpose of enteric coating is to prevent dissolution of the tablet in the stomach, where the stomach acid may degrade the active ingredient, or where the time of passage may compromise its effectiveness, in favor of dissolution in the 
small intestine, where the active principle is better absorbed.




Tablet presses

Tablet press



es, also called tableting machines, range from small, inexpensive bench-top models that make one tablet at a time (single-station presses), no more than a few thousand an hour, and with only around a half-ton pressure, to large, computerized, industrial models (multi-station rotary or eccentric presses) that can make hundreds of thousands to millions of tablets an hour with much greater pressure. Some tablet presses can make extremely large tablets, such as some of the 
toilet cleaning and deodorizing products or 
dishwasher soap. Others can make smaller tablets, from regular 
aspirin to some the size of a 
bb gun pellet. Tablet presses may also be used to form tablets out of a wide variety of materials, from powdered metals to cookie crumbs. The tablet press is an essential piece of machinery for any pharmaceutical and nutraceutical manufacturer.




Pill-splitters



It is sometimes necessary to split tablets into halves or quarters. Tablets are easier to break accurately if scored, but there are devices called 
pill-splitters which cut unscored and scored tablets. Tablets with special coatings (for example enteric coatings or controlled-release coatings) should not be broken before use, as this will expose the tablet core to the digestive juices, short-circuiting the intended delayed-release effect.

The love story of Pyramus and Thisbe, not really a part of 
Roman mythology, is actually a sentimental romance. It is briefly summarized by 








Hyginus







 (Fabulae 242) and more fully elaborated in 



Ovid


 (
Metamorphoses 4).   


Plot



In the Ovidian version, Pyramus and Thisbe is the story of two lovers in the Middle East who occupy connected houses, forbidden by their parents to be wed.  Through a crack in one of the walls, they arrange to meet near a mulberry tree and state their feelings for each other.  Thisbe arrived first, but upon seeing a lioness with a mouth bloody from a recent kill, she fled, leaving behind her veil.  The lioness drank from a nearby fountain-then by chance mutilated the veil Thisbe had left behind.  When Pyramus arrived, he was horrified at the sight of Thisbe's veil, assuming that a fierce beast had killed her.  Pyramus proceeded to then kill himself, thrusting a sword into his groin.  Thisbe returned, eager to tell Pyramus what had happened to her, but she found Pyramus' dead body under the shade of the mulberry tree.  Thisbe, after a brief period of mourning, killed herself.  The combined blood of the bodies seeped into the ground, staining the previously white fruit of the mulberry tree a deep purple.  Thus, the mulberry tree became a symbol of the deaths of these two lovers.      




Ovid's version


The following is a paraphrase of Ovid by 


Thomas Bulfinch

 (The Age of Fable, second edition, 1856):






 

 Pyramus was the handsomest youth, and Thisbe the fairest maiden, in all 





Babylonia




, where 




Semiramis



 reigned.  Their parents occupied adjoining houses; and neighborhood brought the young people together, and acquaintance ripened into love. They would gladly have married, but their parents forbade. One thing however they could not forbid   that love should glow with equal ardor in the bosoms of both. They conversed by signs and glances, and the fire burned more intensely for being covered up. In the wall that parted the two houses there was a crack, caused by some fault in the structure. No one had remarked it before, but the lovers discovered it. What will not love discover!  It afforded a passage to the voice; and tender messages used to pass backward and forward through the gap. As they stood, Pyramus on this side, Thisbe on that, their breaths would mingle.  Cruel wall,  they said,  why do you keep two lovers apart?  But we will not be ungrateful. We owe you, we confess, the privilege of transmitting loving words to willing ears.  Such words they uttered on different sides of the wall; and when night came and they must say farewell, they pressed their lips upon the wall, she on her side, he on his, as they could come no nearer.

Next morning, when 




Aurora



 had put out the stars, and the sun had melted the frost from the grass, they met at the accustomed spot. Then, after lamenting their hard fate, they agreed that next night, when all was still, they would slip away from watchful eyes, leave their dwellings and walk out into the fields; and to insure a meeting, repair to a well-known edifice, standing without the city s bounds, called the Tomb of 
Ninus, and that the one who came first should await the other at the foot of a certain tree.  It was a white 
mulberry tree, and stood near a cool spring. All was agreed on, and they waited impatiently for the sun to go down beneath the waters and night to rise up from them. Then cautiously Thisbe stole forth, unobserved by the family, her head covered with a 
veil, made her way to the monument and sat down under the tree.  As she sat alone in the dim light of the evening she descried a 
lioness, her jaws reeking with recent slaughter, approaching the fountain to slake her thirst.  Thisbe fled at the sight, and sought refuge in the hollow of a rock. As she fled she dropped her veil.  The lioness, after drinking at the spring, turned to retreat to the woods, and seeing the veil on the ground, tossed and rent it with her bloody mouth.


Pyramus, having been delayed, now approached the place of meeting. He saw in the sand the footsteps of the lion, and the color fled from his cheeks at the sight.  Presently he found the veil all rent and bloody.  O, hapless girl,  said he,  I have been the cause of thy death! Thou, more worthy of life than I, hast fallen the first victim.  I will follow. I am the guilty cause, in tempting thee forth to a place of such peril, and not being myself on the spot to guard thee. Come forth, ye lions, from the rocks, and tear this guilty body with your teeth.  He took up the veil, carried it with him to the appointed tree, and covered it with kisses and with tears.  My blood also shall stain your texture,  said he, and drawing his sword plunged it into his heart. The blood spurted from the wound, and tinged the white mulberries of the tree all red; and sinking into the earth reached the roots, so that the red color mounted through the trunk to the fruit.


By this time, Thisbe, still trembling with fear, yet wishing not to disappoint her lover, stepped cautiously forth, looking anxiously for the youth, eager to tell him the danger she had escaped. When she came to the spot and saw the changed color of the mulberries she doubted whether it was the same place. While she hesitated she saw the form of one struggling in the agonies of death. She started back, a shudder ran through her frame as a ripple on the face of the still water when a sudden breeze sweeps over it. But as soon as she recognized her lover, she screamed and beat her breast; embracing the lifeless body, pouring tears into its wounds, and imprinting kisses on the cold lips.  O, Pyramus,  she cried,  what has done this?  Answer me, Pyramus; it is your own Thisbe that speaks. Hear me, dearest, and lift that drooping head!  At the name of Thisbe, Pyramus opened his eyes, then closed them again. She saw her veil stained with blood and the scabbard empty of its sword.  Thy own hand has slain thee, and for my sake,  she said.  I too can be brave for once, and my love is as strong as thine. I will follow thee in death, for I have been the cause; and death, which alone could part us, shall not prevent my joining thee. And ye, unhappy parents of us both, deny us not our united request. As love and death have joined us, let one tomb contain us. And thou, tree, retain the marks of slaughter. Let thy berries still serve for memorials of our blood.   So saying, she plunged the sword into her breast. Her parents ratified her wish, the gods also ratified it. The two bodies were buried in one sepulchre, and the tree ever after brought forth purple berries, as it does to this day.


 







Analysis




Use of gratuitous violence



Roman versions of mythological events are riddled with gratuitous violence, often to the point of absurdity.  In Pyramus and Thisbe however, Ovid actually uses the violence to his own advantage, allying it with the dark tone of the overall story.  The extent of pain that Pyramus expresses when he kills himself serves a dual purpose - it upholds the ideal of the Roman man as well as showing that he is willing to die graphically for the woman he loves.  By contrast, Thisbe's death is described in much less detail to portray the end of the darkness and the conclusion of the story.





Adaptations


The story of Pyramus and Thisbe appears in 


Giovanni Boccaccio

's 






On Famous Women





 as biography number twelve (sometimes thirteen) 1 and in his 
Decameron, in the fifth story on the seventh day, where a desperate housewife falls in love with her neighbor, and communicates with him through a crack in the wall, attracting his attention by dropping pieces of stone and straw through the crack.   







Geoffrey Chaucer



 was among the first to tell the story in 

English
 with his 




The Legend of Good Women



. The  Pyramus and Thisbe  plot appears twice in 





Shakespeare




's works. The plot of 
Romeo and Juliet may draw either from Ovid's Latin retelling in the Metamorphoses, or from 





Golding

Tables is a general name given to a class of 
board games similar to 
backgammon, played on a board with two rows of 12 vertical markings called  points . Players roll dice to determine the movement of pieces. Tables games are among the oldest known board games, and many variants are played throughout the world.



History


The 
ancient Egyptians played a game called 





Senet




, which was similar to modern tables games, with moves controlled by the roll of dice.1 The 





Royal Game of Ur




, played in ancient 
Mesopotamia, is a more likely ancestor. Recent excavations at the  










Burnt City









  in 

Iran
 showed that a similar game existed there around 3000 BC. The artifacts include two dice and 60 pieces. The set is believed to be 100 to 200 years older than the sets found in 










Ur









.2


The 
ancient Romans played a number of games in this family. 





Ludus duodecim scriptorum




 ( game of twelve lines ) used a board with three rows of 12 points each, and the pieces were moved across all three rows according to the roll of dice. Not much specific text about the gameplay has survived.3 





Tabula




, meaning  table  or  board , was similar to modern backgammon in that a board with 24 points was used, and the object of the game was to be the first to bear off all of one's checkers. Three dice were used instead of two, and opposing checkers moved in opposite directions.4 5





In the 11th century 
Shahnameh, the 
Persian poet 






Ferdowsi





  credits 




Burzoe



 with the invention of nard in the 6th century. He describes an encounter between Burzoe and a 
Raja visiting from 

India
. The Raja introduces the game of 
chess, and Burzoe demonstrates nard, played with dice made from 
ivory and 
teak.6


The jeux de tables first appeared in 

France
 during the 11th century and became a frequent pastime for gamblers. In 1254, 



Louis IX


 issued a decree prohibiting his court officials and subjects from playing the games.7 While it is mostly known for its extensive discussion of chess, the 
Alfonso X manuscript 






Libro de los juegos





, completed in 1283, describes rules for a number of dice and tables games.8


In 

English
, the word  tables  is derived from 

Latin
 tabula. Its first use referring to board games documented by the 









Oxford English Dictionary








 was circa AD 700.9 During the 16th century, the name tables was sometimes also used to describe 
chess. Tables should not be confused with 

Tafl
, an unrelated class of board games (albeit linguistically related) played in medieval Scandinavia.




In the Middle East and Central Asia


The game known in the West as 
backgammon is played widely in the 



Middle East


 and 





Central Asia




. It is known as ifranjiah in 

Arabic
 (meaning  
Frankish ), and is referred to as takhte nard in 

Iran
. In 

Israel
 and the Middle East as well, it is known as shesh besh (meaning  six and five ).


The name nardshir comes from the 

Persian
 nard (Wooden block) and shir (lion) referring to the two type of pieces used in play. A common legend associates the game with the founder of the 
Sassanian dynasty, 

Ardashir I
. The oldest known reference to the game is thought to be a passage in the 
Talmud, although some claim it refers to the 

Greek
 game 
Kubeia. 


Many of the early 
Arabic texts which refer to the game comment on the debate regarding the legality and morality of playing the game. This debate was settled by the 
eighth century when all four 
Muslim schools of jurispudence declared the game to be 
Haraam (forbidden), however this did nothing to stop the growth in popularity of the game in the Muslim world and the game is still played today in many Arab countries.



Mahbusa



Mahbusa means  imprisoned . Each player begins with 15 checkers on his opponent's 24-point. If a checker is hit, it is not placed on the bar, but instead, the hitting piece is placed on top, and the point is then controlled by the hitting player. The checker which has been hit is imprisoned and cannot be moved until the opponent removes his piece. Sometimes, a rule is used that requires a player to bring his first checker around to his home board before moving any others. In any case, a rapid advance to  one's own home board is desirable, as imprisoning the opponent's checkers there is highly advantageous. Mahbusa is similar to 





tapa




.



An interesting feature of tables play in some Arab countries is that 

Persian
 or 

Kurdish
 numbers, rather than Arabic ones, are called out by a player announcing his 
dice rolls.




Narde



People in the 
Iranian plateau and 




Caucasus



 region, especially in 

Iran
, 

Armenia
, 

Azerbaijan
, and 

Georgia
, are very fond of playing narde. All 15 of a player's checkers are initially positioned on his own 24-point, but there is a major difference. One is forbidden to put his checker at a point occupied by one's opponent's checker, so there is no hitting or imprisonment in the long narde game. The main strategy is to secure playing  big pairs  by one's own checkers and prevent as much as possible doing the same by the opponent.  


The game is known as 'Fevga' in Greece, 'Moultezim' in Turkey, Mahbusa in the Middle East and 'Ifranjiah' or Frankish in Arabia. It can also be spelt as 'Nard' or 'Nardi'. 


A version known as short narde is a simplified form of Ifranjiah. In Georgia, ifranjiah is played as elsewhere, but called  nardi . In Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, many experienced players also play long narde, which some see as requiring deeper strategy.




Gul bara





Main article: 





Gul bara






Gul bara, sometimes referred to as  rosespring backgammon  or  crazy narde , is a variant popular in some 

Arab
 countries. An unusual feature is that there is no hitting.





In Greece





Bradspel game recovered from the 
Vasa



In 

Greece
, tables games are called tavli (related to the word tavla, meaning  board  or  table , and 
cognate to the Latin tabula). There are three major variants, portes, plakoto, and fevga. Portes resembles 
backgammon, with minor variations: there is no doubling cube, and a backgammon counts only as a gammon (called diplo, Greek for double). Plakoto is very similar to mahbusa or 





tapa




, while fevga is similar to narde or the Turkish variant moultezim. The three are normally played consecutively, in three-, five- or seven-point matches.10




In Japan





Main article: 





Sugoroku






There are two games known as 
sugoroku (  ) in 
Japan. One more closely resembles 
snakes and ladders, while the other is played on a 24-point tables board, using standard tables equipment. The starting position is identical to that of 
backgammon. It differs from most other tables variants in that the pieces are never borne off. Additionally, the use of primes is not permitted.




In Romania


In 

Romania
, one popular tables game is called tabl  (meaning  board , cognate of the Latin tabula). The game is very popular among Romanians and is similar to 
backgammon, with two variations: there is no doubling cube and a backgammon counts only as a gammon (called mar ). Matches are usually played to three points.




In Sweden





A backgammon set, with two dice cups and a doubling cube



Svensk bradspel ( Swedish tables ) is a variant played in 







Sweden






. Players starts with all 15 of their checkers on opposite corners of the board, and play around clockwise. Besides bearing off, there are several other ways to win, such as arranging all of one's checkers in certain pre-determined patterns, or by hitting so many checkers that one's opponent can not bring them in again. Additional points are awarded for a victory while one's opponent has checkers on the bar. Bradspel is played without the doubling cube.11 Interest in bradspel experienced a resurgence following the recovery of a 17th century board from the wreck of the 
Vasa.12




In Turkey


Tavla is a very popular tables game in Turkey. It is very similar to 
backgammon. The major difference is in tavla the doubling cube is not used. Also in tavla both gammons and backgammons are counted as two points called mars. Matches are usually played to five points.


Hapis (Turkish: prison) is another tables game played in Turkey. It is less popular than tavla. It is very similar to Mahbusa played in the Middle East.




Backgammon and variants





Main article: 
Backgammon

Backgammon is the most popular tables variant played in the West. Two players move their pieces in opposing directions, according to the rolls of dice. The use of a doubling cube allows players to increase the stakes of the game. The basis of the modern game can be traced to 
Medieval and 
Renaissance sources, and social and competitive play remain popular in many parts of the world. Backgammon has been studied considerably by 
computer scientists, who have developed software that plays at the level of top human players.

In 
Roman mythology, the goddess Alemonia or Alemona was responsible for feeding 
fetuses 
in utero. 

Early Roman Mythology focused on the interlocking and complex interrelations between gods and humans. In this, the Romans maintained a large selection of divinities with unusually specific areas of authority. A sub-group of deities covered the general realm of infancy and childhood.1 In this area, Alemonia was called upon as a general guardian and 
tutelary deity to protect the health and safety of the unborn.

The 

Egypt
ian city of 

Cairo
  has, in its history, had a significant number of 
fortified gates protecting both the inner and outer city. Apart from the purpose of defense, they were also used for differentiation of the varied social and economic classes. Often the gates were heavily decorated as artistic pieces.


Cairo's gates include:





B b al-Ba r (the Gate of the Shore), built in 
1174 by Bah   al-D n Qaraq sh, in the northern wall, near the northwest corner; destroyed during reign of 
Mu ammad  Al .


B b al-Barak yyah (the Gate of Blessedness?) I, built by 
Jawhar al- aqal ; destroyed in 
1936.


B b al-Barak yyah II, built by 

 al h al-Din
 in 
1184; part of the eastern wall, which was built far to the east with the goal of expanding the city in that direction.


B b al-Faraj (the Gate of Succour), in the southern Cairo wall at the hall where the tomb of Set Seada is located.



Bab El Fetouh



Al-B b al-Jad d (the New Gate), built in 
1170 in the eastern wall; still remains.

History



Wayne County, West Virginia was originally 
Wayne County, Virginia, which was created from part of 
Cabell County, Virginia in 1842. Any references to Wayne County before 1842 in this article refer to the area which would become Wayne County, West Virginia.  The county was named for General  Mad Anthony  Wayne.



Early History



See 
History of Cabell County, West Virginia for information regarding regional history before 
European settlement.




Settlement



There was no white settlement in the area that became Wayne County until after 1794 due to the constant threat of 

Indian
 attack, who were already present. The area was made safe for white settlement in 1794 through the defeat of the 

Shawnee
 at the 

Battle of Fallen Timbers
 by 











General  Mad  Anthony Wayne










. To honor General Wayne, the county was later named for him.


When the first permanent settlers came to Wayne County around the year 1800, the area was part of 
Kanawha County, Virginia. Most of the original 
pioneer settlers were almost all self-sufficient 
farmers. They raised their own food, 
sheep for 
wool clothing, and made their buildings, furnishings and tools out of the surrounding forest. A few 
trading posts provided the manufactured goods the pioneers could not make for themselves. Later, 
grist mills at 

Wayne
, 
Dickson, south of 




East Lynn



 and at 




Lavalette



 ground their 
corn into 
meal and their 
wheat into 
flour.

Morrow County is a 
county located in the 








U.S. state







 of 





Oregon




, on the south side of the 



Columbia River


. The 
county is named for one of its first white settlers, Jackson L. Morrow, who was a member of the state legislature when the county was created. Half of the 




Umatilla Chemical Depot



, which includes the Umatilla Chemical Agent Disposal Facility, is located within the county. In 2000, the county's population was 10,996. The 
seat of the county is 

Heppner
. 

Morrow County is part of the 

Pendleton
 

Hermiston
 
Micropolitan Statistical Area.



 History 


Morrow County was created on 
February 15, 
1884 from the western portion of 

Umatilla County
 and a small portion of eastern 

Wasco County
. 

Heppner
 was designated the temporary county seat at the time the county was created and narrowly defeated 

Lexington
 in the election held in 1887 to determine the permanent county seat.




 Economy 


The principal industries in the county today include agriculture, food processing, lumber, livestock, and recreation. The Columbia River also provides Morrow County with a number of related jobs. A coal-fired generating plant in 

Boardman
 also employs a significant number of people.


Early cattlemen found an abundance of 
rye along the creek bottoms of the region and drove their herds into the area to forage on these natural pastures. 
Ranching was the primary economic force in the county for many years. Increased settlement, the enclosure of the free grazing lands and diminished pastures due to overgrazing, resulted in the decline of ranching during the 19th century, and farming became predominant. The completion of rail lines into the county in 1883 increased access to markets and encouraged wheat production in the area. The advent of technology for 
center pivot irrigation has been a further stimulus to the local economy.


The 
Morrow Port District, situated on the 



Columbia River


 near the town of Boardman, was established in 1957.


The coal-fired electricity generation plant, the Boardman Turbine Coal Plant (601 megawatts), is located 14-miles southwest of the town of Boardman, and is owned by 

Portland General Electric
 (PGE; 66%-owned and operated), 
Idaho Power (10%), 
Pacific Northwest Generating (10%), and 
General Electric Credit Corp. (16%). There are also two 
natural gas-fired plants located at the Port of Morrow; Coyote Springs I (255-276 MW), owned and operated by Portland General Electric; and Coyote Springs II (241-280 MW; PGE operator), a fifty-fifty joint venture of 
Avista Power   

Mirant Corp.

In 
Australian Aboriginal mythology, Eingana is a creator goddess and the mother of all 
water, 
animals, and 
humans.  She is a 
snake goddess of 
death who lives in the 
Dream time.  She has no 
vagina; she simply grew in size and, unable to give birth to the life inside her, had the god 



Barraiya


 open a hole with a spear near her 
anus, so that labor could commence.  Eingana holds a 
sinew that is attached to every living thing; if she lets go of one, the attached creature dies.



 Extract 



Eingana made everything, Eingana had everything inside herself that first time, Eingana is a 
snake. She swallowed all the blackfellows. She took them inside herself, down under the water. Eingana came out. She was big with everything inside her. She came out of a big 
waterhole near Bamboo Creek. Eingana was rolling about, every way on the ground. She was groaning and calling out. She was making a big noise with all the blackfellows, everything inside her belly. No one can see Eingana. In the raintime, when the flood water comes, Eingana stands up out of the middle of the flood water. She looks out at the 
country, she lets go all the 
birds, 
snakes, 
animals, 
children belonging to us.

town





Dolores County is the seventh least populous of the 
64 counties of the 
State of Colorado of the 








United States







.  The county population was 1,844 at 
U.S. Census 2000.1  The 
county seat is 

Dove Creek
.



 History 


Dolores County as well as much of southwestern Colorado is rich in Indian 
ruins and sites of the 
Anasazi.  It is thought that the area has been the site of human habitation since at least 2500 B.C.  According to the Heritage Center, Dolores County contains at least 816 recorded 
archaeological sites as of 1989.   Also, the county contains a site of regional historic interest, the 
Dominguez-Escalante Trail of 1776.  The trail marks a historic 1800-mile trip intended to discover an overland route between 

Santa Fe
, 





New Mexico




 and 

Monterey
, 

California
.2


Dolores County was created by the Colorado legislature on 





February 19




, 
1881 out of the western portions of 

Ouray County
. It was named for the 





Dolores River




. The complete Spanish name was Rio de Nuestra Senora de los Dolores (River of our Lady of Sorrows), as reported by Father 
Silvestre Velez de Escalante in 1776.3  Originally set in 

Rico
, the county seat was moved to Dove Creek in 1941.




Geography


According to the 
U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 1,068 
square miles (2,766 
km ), of which, 1,067 square miles (2,763 km ) of it is land and 1 square miles (3 km ) of it is 
water.  The total area is 0.11% water.


Dolores County, like other counties in Colorado along its border with 

Utah
, is split into two geographically distinct regions, and in fact, under normal travel conditions, it is necessary to leave the county to travel between the two regions.  The western portion of the County along the Utah border is relatively low (6500-7500 feet in elevation) and flat, and consists of irrigated and dryland farming areas.  It is especially well-known for the growing of various varieties of beans, including 
pinto beans and many variety of old 
Anasazi beans.  The eastern portion of the County is located in the highest peaks of the 




San Juan Mountains



, around the old mining and modern tourist town of Rico, and except for cattle grazing in the San Juan National Forest, has virtually no agriculture, in part because its elevations range from 9,000 to 14,000+.  Rico is developing in many ways as a 
bedroom community for the much wealthier town of 
Telluride in 

San Miguel County
 to the north.

Wayne





Richmond (pronounced ) is a city in 

Wayne Township
, 

Wayne County
, in east central 





Indiana




, which borders 





Ohio




. It is sometimes called the  cradle of recorded 
jazz  because some early jazz records originated there at the studio of 






Gennett Records





, a division of the 
Starr Piano Company.1 Richmond is the 
county seat of 

Wayne County
. The city's 2000 population was 39,124. In the 1990s, Richmond's population declined by 1.6 percent.2


History


Richmond was settled along the East Fork of the 



Whitewater River


 in 1806 by 
Quaker families from 





North Carolina




. John Smith and David Hoover were among the earliest settlers. Richmond is still home to several 
Quaker institutions including 
Friends United Meeting, 

Earlham College
 and the 





Earlham School of Religion




.


Richmond is believed to have been the smallest community in the United States with a professional opera company and symphony orchestra. The 
Whitewater Opera has since closed its doors but the Richmond Symphony Orchestra is a source of community pride. 






Will Earhart





 formed the first complete high school orchestra in Richmond in 1899. A later orchestra director, 






Joseph E. Maddy





 went on to found what is now known as the 

Interlochen Center for the Arts
 in Michigan.


A significant group of artists in the late 19th and early 20th centuries came to be known as the 

Richmond Group
. The list of artists includes 






John Elwood Bundy





, 






Charles Conner





, 










George Herbert Baker









, 
Maude Kaufman Eggemeyer and 
John Albert Seaford among others. The 




Richmond Art Museum



 has an outstanding collection of regional and American art.3 Many consider the most significant painting in the collection to be a self portrait of Indiana-born 






William Merritt Chase





.4


Richmond was once known as  the lawnmower capital  because of the lawn mowers manufactured there from the late 19th century through the mid-20th century. Manufacturers included Davis, 
Motomower, 
Dille-McGuire and 
F N. The farm machinery
builder 
Gaar-Scott was based in Richmond.


In the 1920s, Indiana had the strongest 





Ku Klux Klan




 organization in the country under Grand Dragon 


D. C. Stephenson

, with control over the state legislature and an ally in Governor 
Ed Jackson.5 At its height, national membership during the second Klan movement reached 1.5 million, with 300,000 from Indiana.6 Records show that Richmond (home to Whitewater Klan #60) and Wayne County were Klan strongholds, with up to 45 percent of the county's white males having been Klan members.67 At the same time Gennett Records was recording important black jazz artists,8 it also produced private-label contract recordings for the Ku Klux Klan.9 An aspect of official racial segregation existed in Richmond as late as 1965 when the city ended its policy of restricting black firefighters to one station and limiting the promotion opportunities of firefighters and police officers.


After starting out in nearby 

Union City
, Wayne Agricultural Works moved to Richmond. Wayne was a manufacturer of horse-drawn vehicles, including  
kid hacks , a precursor of the motorized 
school bus. Beginning in the early 1930s through the 1940s, several 
automobile designers and manufacturers were located in Richmond. Among the automobiles manufactured there was the  Richmond  which was built by the Wayne Works, the  Rodefeld , the  



Davis


 , the  Pilot , the 



Westcott


 and the 





Crosley




.


In the 1950s, Wayne Works became 





Wayne Corporation




, a well-known 
bus and 
school bus manufacturer, and relocated to a site adjacent to 

Interstate 70
 in 1967. The company was a leader in school bus safety innovations, but closed in 1992 during a period of school bus manufacturing industry consolidations.


Richmond was known as the 
Rose City because of the many varieties once grown there by Hill's Roses in several sprawling complexes of 
greenhouses. The company once had about 34 acres under glass. The Richmond Rose Festival honored the rose industry and was a popular summer attraction.


Richmond is located on the 








National Road







,10 which became part of the system of 
National Auto Trails. The highway is now known as 
U.S. Highway 40. One of the extant 



Madonna of the Trail


 monuments was dedicated at Richmond on 
October 28, 
192811 The monument sits in a corner of Glen Miller Park adjacent to U.S. 40.


On 
April 6, 
1968, several downtown blocks were destroyed or damaged by a 






natural gas explosion and fire





, killing 41 people and injuring more than 150.12 Thereafter, the main street through downtown was closed to traffic and the Downtown Promenade was built in 1972 (and later expanded in 1978). The five-block pedestrian mall was later torn down and the street reopened to traffic in 1997 as part of an urban revitalization effort.


A 








Powerball







 lottery ticket sold in Richmond won approximately $314 million (annuity value) in the 
August 25, 
2007 drawing. In 1998, a group of 13 machine-shop workers from Ohio won Powerball on a ticket 





that had also been purchased in Richmond




. It won $295.7 million (annuity). The two tickets were sold at two different 
Speedway convenience stores about three miles apart; both sets of winners also chose the 
cash option.




Architecture


Richmond is noted for its historic architecture. In 2003, a book entitled Richmond Indiana: Its Physical Development and Aesthetic Heritage to 1920 by 

Cornell University
 architectural historians, Michael and Mary Raddant Tomlan, was published by the 








Indiana Historical Society







. This work is the result of twenty five years of research on Richmond's growth and development. Particularly notable buildings are the 1902 Pennsylvania Railroad Station designed by 

Daniel Burnham
 and the 1893 Wayne County Court House designed by 
James W. McLaughlin of Cincinnati. Local architects of note include 










John A. Hasecoster









, 
William S. Kaufman and 
Stephen O. Yates. Five large districts and several individual buildings are listed in the 





National Register of Historic Places




, the 
Historic American Buildings Survey and the 
Historic American Engineering Record.




Educational institutions







Richmond High School
 includes the 




Richmond Art Museum



 and 






Civic Hall Performing Arts Center





 and the Tiernan Center, America's 5th largest high school gym.



Seton Catholic High School (founded 2002), a junior and senior high school, is the area's only religious high school.  It is based in the former home of St. Andrew High School (1899-1936) and, more recently, St. Andrew Elementary School, adjacent to St. Andrew Church of the 
Richmond Catholic Community.


Richmond has four colleges: 

Earlham College
, 

Indiana University East
, 

Ivy Tech Community College of Indiana
 and the 

Purdue University
 School of Technology.


Richmond is home to two seminaries: 





Earlham School of Religion




 (

Bethany Theological Seminary
 (


Church of the Brethren

)






Religious groups





Richmond is the headquarters of the 
Friends United Meeting of the

Jorge Chavez International Airport (
IATA: LIM, 
ICAO: SPIM), known as Aeropuerto Internacional Jorge Chavez in 

Spanish
, is 






Peru





's main international and domestic 
airport. It is located in 

Callao
, 11 km (7 miles) from the 

Historic Centre of Lima
 and 17 km (11 miles) from 



Miraflores


. Callao is the port city now fully integrated with Lima, the nation's capital. In 
2007, the airport handled 7,505,832 passengers and 92,880 aircraft movements.


For many years it was the hub for now defunct 
Aeroperu and 
Compania de Aviacion Faucett, one of the oldest airlines in 










Latin America









. Now it serves as a 
hub for many aviation companies.



 History 


The first airport of Lima was the Limatambo Airport, located in 



San Isidro


, which ceased operations in 1960 due to lack of space and capacity to handle the increasing flights. In that same year, the Lima-Callao International Airport began to operate in 

Callao
. In June 1965, the airport was renamed as  Aeropuerto Internacional Jorge Chavez  after French-Peruvian aviator 
Jorge Chavez Dartnell and in December 1965, the current terminal building was inaugurated.


Over time, the airport showed signals of decay, lack of space for passengers and outdated technology in radar and safety. In 2001, in order to improve and expand its infrastructure, the airport was concessioned by the Peruvian government to 
Lima Airport Partners (LAP), now composed by 





Fraport




 and two other minor partners, remaining the 
air traffic control managed by the Peruvian Corporation of Airports and Commercial Aviation (
CORPAC). 


In February 2005, the first phase of the renovation and expansion project was completed. It included the 
Peru Plaza Commercial Center and a new 
concourse with 18 gates, 7 of them with 
boarding bridges. In June 2007 a four-star hotel was opened in front of the terminal. The second phase, now in construction, includes the expansion of the concourse with 12 additional boarding bridges and the expansion of the immigration hall, which will be completed in December 2008. The construction of a second runway is another very important project, which will be completed in 2011.


Jorge Chavez International Airport was awarded the title of best airport in 



South America


 by 


Skytrax

 
World Airports Awards 2005, and it came in second place in the 2008 survey.




 Hotel and commercial infrastructure 






 
Hotel Ramada Costa del Sol: This four-star hotel is located in front of the air control tower and consists of five floors, which include restaurant, cafeteria, bar, spa, swimming pool, gymnasium, beauty salon, business center and conference rooms. The building is covered by acoustic panels which keep out noise from the airplanes. The hotel opened June 12, 2007 and is the fifth hotel of the Costa del Sol hotel chain, the others being located in 
Tumbes, 

Piura
, 

Chiclayo
 and 

Cajamarca
.


 
Peru Plaza Commercial Center: Made up of a conjunction of retail stores offering Peruvian products such as clothing, handicrafts, silver jewelry, perfumes, liquors, chocolates, and other items. It also houses food shops which sell various types of food including international franchises such as 








McDonald's







, 

Starbucks
, 
Dunkin Donuts and 
Papa John's.






 Services 



 Transporation 


Transportation between the airport and the city is only provided by taxis and tour buses and vans. For security reasons it is strongly recommended that one only takes taxis offered by registered companies at the arrivals areas of the airport.

Clara Bow

Clara Gordon Bow

September 27, 1965 (aged 60)


West Los Angeles, 

California






Clara Gordon Bow (
July 29, 
1905   
September 27 
1965) was an American 
actress and 
sex symbol, who rose to fame in the 
silent film era of the 1920s. Bow was renowned for her sexual magnetism and became known around the world as  The 
It girl , where  It  was commonly understood to mean sex appeal. Though she was shy and reclusive,1
she is known as the quintessential 
flapper.



Early life


Bow was born in a tenement in 
Brooklyn, New York, the only surviving child of a 
dysfunctional family afflicted with 
mental illness, poverty, and 
physical and 
emotional abuse. She was the third child of Robert Bow and Sarah Gordon; the first two, also daughters, were short lived. One lived for two hours, the other for two days. Bow's mother, hoping that her third child would also die at birth, did not bother to call a doctor or get a 
birth certificate. Bow did not cry after she was born so her Mother thought her to be dead and tried to make sure of it by shaking her but miraculously, the baby awoke. 2


As a child, Bow was a tomboy and played games such as baseball in the streets with the boys. Bow's only true friend, Johnny, was severely burned and died in her arms when she was nine years old. Years later, she could make herself cry at will on a movie set by asking the band to play the lullaby  
Rock-a-bye Baby . She said it reminded her of Johnny because that was the song Johnny's mother would sing to help him fall asleep.


Bow's mother was an occasional 
prostitute who suffered from 
mental illness and 
epilepsy. She was noted for her frequent public affairs with local 
firemen. Bow's father, Robert Bow, was rarely present and may have had a 
mental impairment. Whenever he returned home, he was verbally and physically abusive to both wife and daughter. Bow's father reportedly 
molested her when she was between 15 and 16 years old.3




Early career


Always an avid movie fan, Bow entered and won the 
Motion Picture Magazine's  Fame and Fortune  contest in 1921, the grand prize being a part in a 
film.  According to the articles in February, March, and April 1928 in Motion Picture Classic, in which she told her life story, she asked her father for one dollar to have some pictures taken for the contest's judges.  She went to a Brooklyn photographer, who took two pictures which she said  were terrible .  Although she hated the pictures of her wearing a red tam and her only nice dress, the contest judges were impressed. After numerous screen tests, Bow was selected the winner. She won a part in 

Beyond the Rainbow
 (1922), but to her humiliation and disappointment, her scenes were cut from the final print and were not seen until the film was 
restored years later. Bow preferred playing poker with her cook, maid, and chauffeur over attending her movie premieres.


Bow had problems with her mother, who would tell Bow that being an actor was the same as being a prostitute.4 Bow's mother took to threatening to kill Bow. One night, Bow awoke to find her mother holding a butcher knife above her head. She said,  I'm gonna kill you, Clara. It'll be better. 5   Bow ran and locked herself in a closet until her grandmother came home.




Fame and Fortune

Bow's screen debut came with her next film, 









Down to the Sea in Ships








 (1922). She began to appear in numerous small movie roles. All the while, she felt guilty over her mother's disapproval. In 1923, Bow was on the set when she learned that her mother had died. She was devastated, feeling that her acting was somehow responsible for her mother's insanity and death.6


Her earliest films were all East Coast productions. Bow got her big break when an officer of Preferred Pictures approached her on the set. She offered Bow free train fare to make a screen test in Hollywood. The first time Preferred Pictures head 
B.P. Schulberg saw disheveled Bow in her one ragged dress, he was dismayed. He was reluctant even to give her a screen test, but when he finally did the results astounded him. Bow was already adept at 










pantomime









, and she could cry on command.

Starting with Maytime (1923), Schulberg cast Bow in a series of small roles. She nearly always stole her scenes. However, instead of creating projects for her, he loaned her out to other studios.  Nevertheless, Bow started to make a name for herself through these many small roles and was selected as one of the 
WAMPAS Baby Stars in 1924.


As soon as Bow started to make money, she brought her father to live with her in Hollywood. For the next few years, she funded numerous business ventures for him, including a restaurant and a dry cleaner's, all of which failed.  He soon became a drunken nuisance on her sets, where he would try to pick up young girls by telling them his daughter was Clara Bow. Despite the behavior of her unwanted relative, she was adored during this time of her career.


In 1925, Schulberg cast Bow in 

The Plastic Age
. The movie was a huge hit, and Bow was suddenly the studio's most popular star. She also began to date her co-star 


Gilbert Roland

, who would become the first of many fiances. Bow followed her first big success with Mantrap (1926), directed by 


Victor Fleming

. Though he was twice her age, Bow quickly fell in love with her director. She began seeing both Roland and Fleming at the same time.




The It Girl


In 1927, Bow reached the heights of her popularity with the film 

It
; the film was based on a story written by 










Elinor Glyn









, and upon the film's release, Bow became known as  The 
It Girl .  In Glynn's story, It, a character explains what  It  really is:   It...that strange magnetism which attracts both sexes...entirely unself-conscious...full of self-confidence...indifferent to the effect...she is producing and uninfluenced by others.  More commonly,  It  was taken to mean sex appeal.  It, hell,  quipped 


Dorothy Parker

,  She had those. 7


This image was enhanced by various off-screen love affairs publicized by the 
tabloid press. However, some Hollywood insiders considered her socially undesirable, especially in light of rumored sexual escapades with many famous men of the time. 
Bela Lugosi, 


Gary Cooper

,  


Gilbert Roland

, 
John Wayne, director 


Victor Fleming

, and 



John Gilbert


 were all reputed to have been among her many lovers. In 1929, Lugosi's wife, Beatrice Weeks, cited Bow as the other party in their divorce.





Response to a fan letter (1927)



Bow's alleged 
alcoholism, 
drug abuse and 
mental illness, were also becoming problems for the studios. 



Budd Schulberg


, the 
producer's son, wrote in his memoir Moving Pictures,  There was one subject on which the staid old Hollywood establishment would agree: Clara Bow, no matter how great her popularity, was a low life and a disgrace to the community.  8  


However, Bow was praised for her vitality and enthusiasm   
Adolph Zukor once said that  She danced even when her feet weren't moving 9    though her roles rarely allowed her to show much range. In the early 1930s, Motion Picture magazine complained that the studio never gave her film plots any thought beyond  Hey, let's put Clara in a sailor suit!  At least one important film writer, 









Adela Rogers St. Johns








, felt Bow had enormous promise that was never tapped by the studios.




Paramount
 went out of its way to humiliate the increasingly emotionally-frail actress by canceling her films, docking her pay, charging her for unreturned costumes, and insisting that she pay for her publicity photographs. Her contract also included a morality clause offering her a bonus of $500,000 for behaving like a lady and staying out of the newspapers.



Screenshot from  Wings  (1927)



In 1927, Bow starred in 
Wings, a war picture largely rewritten to accommodate her, as she was Paramount's biggest star at the time. The film went on to win the first 



Academy Award for Best Picture


. In 1928, Bow wrote the foreword for a novelization of her film 








The Fleet's In







. Between 1927 and 1930, Bow was one of Hollywood's top five box office attractions.10


Bow's career continued with limited success into the early sound film era. She worried that her strong 

Brooklyn
 dialect would destroy much of her mystique.11   Bow began experiencing microphone fright on the sets of her sound films. A visibly nervous Bow had to do a number of retakes in 
The Wild Party, her first talkie, because her eyes kept wandering up to the microphone overhead . 



Greta Garbo


 was given two years to prepare for talking pictures, Bow was given only two weeks. Scandal and a damaging court trial involving former assistant Daisy DeVoe further tarnished Bow's image. Paramount released her from her contract in late 1931. 


Following a brief period away from Hollywood, Bow signed a two-picture deal with 
Fox Film Corporation and returned to the screen in the early talkie classic 
Call Her Savage (1932). Although the film was a success, Bow opted for marriage and motherhood, and ended her film career after the release of 
Hoopla the following year.




Later life


The 
1930 U.S. Census lists Bow's residence as 512 North Bedford Drive in 

Beverly Hills, California
. Her home's value was listed as $25,000, higher than most others on her block at the time.   


Bow and cowboy actor 

Rex Bell
 (actually George F. Beldon), later a 
Lieutenant Governor of 





Nevada




, married in 1932 and had two sons, Tony Beldon (born 1934, changed name to Rex Anthony Bell, Jr.) and George Beldon, Jr. (born 1938). Bow retired from acting in 1933. Her last public exposure, albeit fleeting, was a guest appearance on the radio show 

Truth or Consequences
 in 1947; Bow provided the voice of  Mrs. Hush .


Clara Bow was actually one of the actresses considered for the role of Scarlett O'Hara in Gone With The Wind (1939). However, when David O. Selznick examined the long list of names he decided to lean towards the screen testing of actresses who had the numbers 1 or 2 in terms of rating next to their names. Hence, Clara was never looked up to do a screen test.


In 1944, while her husband was running for the 
U.S. House of Representatives Bow tried to commit suicide.12 After being diagnosed with 
schizophrenia in 1949, Bow entered a treatment regimen that included 
 shock treatments. Later, her husband sent her to one of the top mental institutions in the nation. Doctors found out that Bow had been raped by her father at a young age. 


Bow spent her last years living in a modest house, living off an estate worth about $500,000 at the time of her death.2 She died on 
September 27 
1965 of a 
heart attack and was interred in the 
Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in 




Glendale, California



.




Honors


For her contributions to the motion picture industry, Bow was given a star on the 










Hollywood Walk of Fame









.


In 1994, she was honored with an image on a 
United States postage stamp designed by caricaturist 

Al Hirschfeld
.




Quotes


 Even now I can't trust life. It did too many awful things to me as a kid. 


 I was dancin' on a table with just a few clothes on when my Mama left me for good. 


 The more I see of men, the more I like dogs. 




Urban myths


The book 






Hollywood Babylon





 spread the 
urban myth that Bow's friendship with members of the 1927 


University of Southern California

 football team included group sex with the entire team. During her lifetime, Bow was the subject of wild rumors regarding her sex life, none substantiated.13




Bow in popular culture





 In 


Tennessee Williams

' play 




The Night of the Iguana



, Hannah Jelkes explains to Reverend Shannon that when she was 16, a young man made advances toward her in a movie theatre and was arrested.  To get him off the hook, she says,  I told the police it was a Clara Bow picture well, it was a Clara Bow picture and I was just over-excited. 


 The alternative rock band 


50 Foot Wave

 entitled a song  Clara Bow  on their CD Golden Ocean.


 Bow is mentioned in the song  Condition of the Heart  by 


Prince

 on his album 

Around the World in a Day
.


 











Max Fleischer










's cartoon character 


















Betty Boop

















 was modeled after Bow and entertainer 








Helen Kane







 (the  boop-boop-a-doop-girl ).


Bow's mass of tangled red hair was one of her most famous features. When fans of the new star found out she put 
henna in her hair, sales of the dye tripled.13   


Bow applied her red lipstick in the shape of a heart.  Women who imitated this shape were said to be putting a  Clara Bow  on their mouths.13


Bow was mentioned in the lyrics of the song  Chop Suey  in 
Rodgers   Hammerstein's musical comedy 

Flower Drum Song
''


She is Effy's idol in the E4 popular show 

Skins
.14


An autographed picture of Bow is offered as a consolation prize of a beauty contest in the 1931 Gershwin musical  Of Thee I Sing .
