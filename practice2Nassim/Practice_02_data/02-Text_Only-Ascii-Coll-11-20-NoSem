Neural Darwinism, a large scale theory of brain function by 

Gerald Edelman
, was initially published in 1978, in a book called The Mindful Brain (MIT Press). It was extended and published in the 1989 book Neural Darwinism - The Theory of Neuronal Group Selection.

Edelman won the 

Nobel Prize
 in 1972 for his work in immunology showing how the population of 
lymphocytes capable of binding to a foreign antigen is increased by differential clonal multiplication following 
antigen discovery.  Essentially, this proved that the human body is capable of creating 
complex adaptive systems as a result of local events with feedback.  Edelman s interest in selective systems expanded into the fields of 
neurobiology and 
neurophysiology, and in Neural Darwinism, Edelman puts forth a theory called  neuronal group selection .  It contains three major parts:





 Anatomical connectivity in the brain occurs via selective mechanochemical events that take place 
epigenetically during development.  This creates a diverse primary repertoire by differential reproduction.


 Once structural diversity is established anatomically, a second selective process occurs during 
postnatal behavioral experience through epigenetic modifications in the strength of 
synaptic connections between neuronal groups.  This creates a diverse secondary repertoire by differential amplification.


 Reentrant signaling between neuronal groups allows for spatiotemporal continuity in response to real-world interactions.





 Degeneracy 



With neuronal heterogeneity (called degeneracy), it is possible to test the many circuits (on the order of 30 billion neurons with an estimated one million billion connections between them in the human brain) with a diverse set of inputs, to see which neuronal groups respond  appropriately  statistically. Functional  distributed  (widespread) brain circuits thus emerge as a result.


Edelman goes into some detail about how brain development depends on a variety of 
cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) and 
substrate adhesion molecules (SAMs) on cell surfaces which allow cells to dynamically control their intercellular binding properties.  This surface modulation allows cell collectives to effectively  signal  as the group aggregates, which helps govern 
morphogenesis.  So morphology depends on CAM and SAM function.  And CAM and SAM function also depend on developing morphology. 


Edelman theorized that cell proliferation, cell migration, cell death, neuron arbor distribution, and 
neurite branching are also governed by similar selective processes.




 Synaptic modification 



Once the basic variegated anatomical structure of the brain is laid down during early development, it is more or less fixed.  But given the numerous and diverse collection of available circuitry, there are bound to be functionally equivalent albeit anatomically non-
isomorphic neuronal groups capable of responding to certain sensory input. This creates a competitive environment where circuit groups proficient in their responses to certain inputs are  chosen  through the enhancement of the synaptic 
efficacies of the selected network.  This leads to an increased probability that the same network will respond to similar or identical signals at a future time.  This occurs through the strengthening of neuron-to-neuron synapses. And these adjustments allow for neural 
plasticity along a fairly quick timetable.




 Reentry 



The last part of the theory attempts to explain how we experience spatiotemporal consistency in our interaction with environmental stimuli.  Edelman proposes a model of reentrant signaling whereby a disjunctive, multimodal sampling of the same stimulus event correlated in time leads to self-organizing intelligence.  Put another way, multiple neuronal groups can be used to sample a given stimulus set in parallel and communicate between these disjunctive groups with incurred 
latency.




 Support for the theory 



It has been suggested that 


Friedrich Hayek

 had earlier proposed a similar idea in his book The Sensory Order: An Inquiry into the Foundations of Theoretical Psychology, published in 1952.


Other leading proponents include 


Daniel Dennett

, 

William H. Calvin
, and 
Linda B. Smith.

In 
mathematics, a polynomial is an 
expression constructed from 
variables (also known as 
indeterminates) and 
constants, using the operations of 
addition, 
subtraction, 
multiplication, and 
raising to constant 
non-negative integer powers. For example, x^2 - 4x + 7\,  is a polynomial, but  x^2 - 4/x + 7x^{3/2}\, is not, because its second 
term involves division by the variable x (which amounts to multiplication by a negative power of x), and also because its third term contains an exponent that is not an integer.

Polynomials are one of the most important concepts in algebra and throughout mathematics and science. They are used to form polynomial equations, which encode a wide range of problems, from elementary 
word problems to complicated problems in the sciences; they are used to define polynomial functions, which appear in settings ranging from basic 
chemistry and 
physics to 
economics, and are used in 
calculus and 
numerical analysis to approximate other functions. Polynomials are used to construct 
polynomial rings, one of the most powerful concepts in 
algebra and 
algebraic geometry.



Overview


A polynomial is either zero, or can be written as the sum of one or more non-zero 
terms. The number of terms is finite. These terms consist of a constant (called the 
coefficient of the term) multiplied by zero or more 
variables (which are usually represented by letters). Each variable may have an 
exponent that is a non-negative integer.  The exponent on a variable in a term is equal to the 
 degree of that variable in that term. Since x=x^1, the degree of a variable without a written exponent is one.  A term with no variables is called a 
constant term, or just a constant.  The degree of a constant term is 0. The coefficient of a term may be any number, including fractions, irrational numbers, negative numbers, and 
complex numbers.


For example, 




  -5x^2y\,


is a term. The 
coefficient is  5, the variables are x and y, the degree of x is two, and the degree of y is one.


The degree of the entire term is the sum of the degrees of each variable in it.  In the example above, the degree is 2 + 1 = 3.


A polynomial is a sum of terms. For example, the following is a polynomial:




\underbrace{_\,3x^2}_{\begin{smallmatrix}\mathrm{term}\\\mathrm{1}\end{smallmatrix}} \underbrace{-_\,5x}_{\begin{smallmatrix}\mathrm{term}\\\mathrm{2}\end{smallmatrix}} \underbrace{+_\,4}_{\begin{smallmatrix}\mathrm{term}\\\mathrm{3}\end{smallmatrix}} 


It consists of three terms: the first is degree two, the second is degree one, and the third is degree zero. Here    5x  stands for  + ( 5)x , so the coefficient of the middle term is  5.


When a polynomial in one variable is arranged in the traditional order, the terms of higher degree come before the terms of lower degree.  In the first term above, the coefficient is 3, the variable is x, and the exponent is 2.  In the second term, the coefficient is  5.  The third term is a constant.  The degree of a non-zero polynomial is the largest degree of any one term.  In the example, the polynomial has degree two.



Alternative forms



An expression that can be converted to polynomial form through a sequence of applications of the 
commutative,  
associative, and 
distributive laws is usually considered to be a polynomial. For instance


(x+1)^3\,


is a polynomial because it can be worked out to x^3+3x^2+3x+1. Similarly




\frac{x^3}{12}


is considered a valid term in a polynomial, even though it involves a division, because it is equivalent to \tfrac{1}{12}x^3 and \tfrac{1}{12} is just a constant. The coefficient of this term is therefore \tfrac{1}{12}. For similar reasons, if complex coefficients are allowed, one may have a single term like (2+3i)x^3; even though it looks like it should be worked out to two terms, the complex number 2+3i is in fact just a single coefficient in this case that happens to require a  +  to be written down.


Division by an expression containing a variable is not generally allowed in polynomials.1 For example,


  {1 \over x^2 + 1} \,

is not a polynomial because it includes division by a variable. Similarly, 


 ( 5 + y ) ^ x ,\,

is not a polynomial, because it has a variable exponent. 


Since subtraction can be treated as addition of the additive opposite, and since exponentiation to a constant positive whole number power can be treated as repeated multiplication, polynomials can be constructed from constants and variables with just the two operations addition and multiplication.




Polynomial functions



A polynomial function is a function defined by 
evaluating a polynomial. A function   of one argument is called a polynomial function if it satisfies




 fnof;(x) = anxn + an 1xn 1 + ... + a2x2 + a1x + a0

for all arguments x, where n is a nonnegative integer and a0, a1,a2, ..., an are constant coefficients.


For example, the function f, taking real numbers to real numbers, defined by




 f(x) = x^3 - x\, 


is a polynomial function of one argument. Polynomial functions of multiple arguments can also be defined, using polynomials in multiple variables, as in




 f(x,y)= 2x^3+4x^2y+xy^5+y^2-7.\,


Polynomial functions are an important class of 
smooth functions.




Polynomial equations



A polynomial equation is an 
equation in which a polynomial is set equal to another polynomial.




  3x^2 + 4x -5 = 0 \, 


is a polynomial equation. In case of a polynomial equation the variable is considered an 
unknown, and one seeks to find the possible values for which both members of the equation evaluate to the same value (in general more than one solution may exist). A polynomial equation is to be contrasted with a polynomial identity like (x + y)(x   y) = x2 y2, where both members represent the same polynomial in different forms, and as a consequence any evaluation of both members will give a valid equality.





Elementary properties of polynomials






 A 
sum of polynomials is a polynomial


 A 
product of polynomials is a polynomial


 The 
derivative of a polynomial function is a polynomial function


 Any primitive or 
antiderivative of a polynomial function is a polynomial function




Polynomials serve to approximate other 
functions, such as 
sine, 
cosine, and 
exponential.


All polynomials have an expanded form, in which the 
distributive law has been used to remove all parentheses. All polynomials with 
real or 
complex coefficients also have a factored form in which the polynomial is written as a product of linear polynomials.  For example, the polynomial




 x^2 - 2x - 3 \,


is the expanded form of the polynomial




(x - 3)(x + 1)\,,


which is written in factored form. Note that the constants in the linear polynomials (like -3 and +1 in the above example) may be 
complex numbers in certain cases, even if all coefficients of the expanded form are real numbers. This is because the field of real numbers is not 
algebraically closed; however, the 
fundamental theorem of algebra states that the field of 
complex numbers is algebraically closed.


In school algebra, students learn to move easily from one form to the other (see: 
factoring).


Every polynomial in one variable is equivalent to a polynomial with the form 




a_n x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0.


This form is sometimes taken as the definition of a polynomial in one variable.


Evaluation of a polynomial consists of assigning a number to each variable and carrying out the indicated multiplications and additions.  Evaluation is sometimes performed more efficiently using the 
Horner scheme


((\ldots(a_n x + a_{n-1})x + ... + a_2)x + a_1)x + a_0.\,


In elementary 
algebra, methods are given for solving all first degree and second degree polynomial equations in one variable.  In the case of polynomial equations, the variable is often called an unknown.  The number of solutions may not exceed the degree, and will equal the degree when 
multiplicity of solutions and 
complex number solutions are counted.  This fact is called the 
fundamental theorem of algebra.


A system of polynomial equations is a set of equations in which a given variable must take on the same value everywhere it appears in any of the equations.  Systems of equations are usually grouped with a single open brace on the left.  In 
elementary algebra, methods are given for solving a 
system of linear equations in several unknowns.  To get a unique solution, the number of equations should equal the number of unknowns.  If there are more unknowns than equations, the system is called 
underdetermined.  If there are more equations than unknowns, the system is called 
overdetermined.  This important subject is studied extensively in the area of mathematics known as 
linear algebra.  Overdetermined systems are common in practical applications.  For example, one U.S. mapping survey used computers to solve 2.5 million equations in 400,000 unknowns. 2

History


Determining the roots of polynomials, or  solving algebraic equations , is among the oldest problems in mathematics.  However, the elegant and practical notation we use today only developed beginning in the 15th century.  Before that, equations are written out in words.  For example, an algebra problem from the Chinese 






Arithmetic in Nine Sections





, circa 200 BCE, begins  Three sheafs of good crop, two sheafs of mediocre crop, and one sheaf of bad crop are sold for 29 dou.   We would write 3x + 2y + z = 29.



Notation





Main article: 
History of mathematical notation

The earliest known use of the equal sign is in 

Robert Recorde
's The Whetstone of Witte, 1557.  The signs + for addition,  minus; for subtraction, and the use of a letter for an unknown appear in 





Michael Stifel




's Arithemetica integra, 1544.  
Rene Descartes, in La geometrie, 1637, introduced the concept of the graph of a polynomial equation.  He popularized the use of letters from the beginning of the alphabet to denote constants and letters from the end of the alphabet to denote variables, as can be seen above, in the general formula for a polynomial in one variable, where the a 's denote constants and x denotes a variable.  Descartes introduced the use of superscripts to denote exponents as well. 3





Solving polynomial equations



Every polynomial corresponds to a polynomial function, where f(x) is set equal to the polynomial, and to a polynomial equation, where the polynomial is set equal to zero.  The solutions to the equation are called the roots of the polynomial and they are the zeroes of the function and the x-intercepts of its graph.  If x = a is a root of a polynomial, then (x  minus; a) is a factor of that polynomial. 


Some polynomials, such as f(x) = x2 + 1, do not have any roots among the 
real numbers. If, however, the set of allowed candidates is expanded to the 
complex numbers, every (non-constant) polynomial has at least one distinct root; this follows from the 
fundamental theorem of algebra.


There is a difference between approximating roots and finding exact roots. Formulas for the roots of polynomials up to a 
degree of 2 have been known since ancient times (see 
quadratic equation) and up to a degree of 4 since the 

16th century
 (see 

Gerolamo Cardano
, 
Niccolo Fontana Tartaglia). But formulas for degree 5 eluded researchers. In 1824, 


Niels Henrik Abel

 proved the striking result that there can be no general formula (involving only the arithmetical operations and radicals) for the roots of a polynomial of degree 5 or greater in terms of its coefficients (see 
Abel-Ruffini theorem). This result marked the start of 
Galois theory which engages in a detailed study of relationships among roots of polynomials.


Numerically solving a polynomial equation in one unknown is easily done on computer by the 







Durand-Kerner method






 or by some other 
root-finding algorithm. The reduction of equations in several unknowns to equations each in one unknown is discussed in the article on the 
Buchberger's algorithm. The special case where all the polynomials are of degree one is called a 
system of linear equations, for which a range of different 
solution methods exist, including the classical 
gaussian elimination.


It has been shown by 
Richard Birkeland and 
Karl Meyr that the roots of any polynomial may be expressed in terms of multivariate 
hypergeometric functions.  


Ferdinand von Lindemann

 and 
Hiroshi Umemura showed that the roots may also be expressed in terms of 
Siegel modular functions, generalizations of the 
theta functions that appear in the theory of 
elliptic functions.  These characterizations of the roots of arbitrary polynomials are generalizations of the methods previously discovered to solve the 
quintic equation.




 Graphs 


A polynomial function in one real variable can be represented by a 
graph.



 The graph of the zero polynomial 


f(x) = 0


is the x-axis.







 The graph of a degree 0 polynomial


f(x) = a0 ,  where a0   0, 


is a horizontal line with y-intercept a0







 The graph of a degree 1 polynomial (or linear function)


f(x) = a0 + a1x , where a1   0,


is an oblique line with y-intercept a0 and 
slope a1.







 The graph of a degree 2 polynomial


f(x) = a0 + a1x + a2x2, where a2   0


is a 
parabola.







 The graph of any polynomial with degree 2 or greater


f(x) = a0 + a1x + a2x2 +  . . .  + anxn  , where an   0  and n   2 


is a continuous non-linear curve.




Polynomial graphs are analyzed  in calculus using intercepts, slopes, concavity, and end behavior.


The illustrations below show graphs of polynomials.








Polynomial of degree 2:
f(x) = x2 - x - 2= (x+1)(x-2)







Polynomial of degree 3:
f(x) = x3/5 + 4x2/5 - 7x/5 - 2= 1/5 (x+5)(x+1)(x-2)









Polynomial of degree 4:
f(x) = 1/14 (x+4)(x+1)(x-1)(x-3) + 0.5







Polynomial of degree 5:
f(x) = 1/20 (x+4)(x+2)(x+1)(x-1)(x-3) + 2











Polynomials and calculus





Main article: 
Calculus with polynomials

One important aspect of calculus is the project of analyzing complicated functions by means of approximating them with polynomials. The culmination of these efforts is 




Taylor's theorem



, which roughly states that every 
differentiable function locally looks like a polynomial, and the 






Stone-Weierstrass theorem





, which states that every 
continuous function defined on a 
compact 
interval of the real axis can be approximated on the whole interval as closely as desired by a polynomial. Polynomials are also frequently used to 
interpolate functions.



Quotients of polynomials are called 
rational expressions, and functions that evaluate rational expressions are called 
rational functions. Rational functions are the only functions that can be evaluated on a 
computer by a fixed sequence of instructions involving operations of addition, multiplication, division, which operations on floating point numbers are usually implemented in 
hardware. All the other functions that computers need to evaluate, such as 
trigonometric functions, 
logarithms and 
exponential functions, must then be computed in 
software that may use approximations to those functions on certain intervals by rational functions, and possibly iteration.


Calculating derivatives and integrals of polynomials is particularly simple. For the polynomial


\sum_{i=0}^n a_i x^i

the derivative with respect to x is


\sum_{i=1}^n a_i i x^{i-1}

and the indefinite integral is


\sum_{i=0}^n {a_i\over i+1} x^{i+1}+c.






Abstract algebra





Main article: 
Polynomial ring


In 
abstract algebra, one must take care to distinguish between polynomials and polynomial functions. A polynomial f in one variable X over a 
ring R is defined to be a formal expression of the form


 f = a_n X^n + a_{n - 1} X^{n - 1} + \cdots + a_1 X^1 + a_0X^0

where n is a natural number, the coefficients a_0,\ldots,a_n are elements of R, Here X is a formal symbol, whose powers Xi are at this point just placeholders for the corresponding coefficients ai, so that the given formal expression is just a way to encode the sequence (an, ,a1,a0). Two polynomials sharing the same value of n are considered to be equal if and only if the sequences of their coefficients are equal; furthermore any polynomial is equal to any polynomial with greater value of n obtained from it by adding terms in front whose coefficient is zero. These polynomials can be added by simply adding corresponding coefficients (the rule for extending by terms with zero coefficients can be used to make sure such coefficients exist). Thus each polynomial is actually equal to the sum of the terms used in its formal expression, if such a term aiXi is interpreted as a polynomial that has zero coefficients at all powers of X other than Xi. Then to define multiplication, it suffices by the 
distributive law to describe the product of any two such terms, which is given by the rule





 a X^k \; b X^l = ab X^{k+l}   for all elements a, b of the ring R and all 
natural numbers k and l.


Thus the set of all polynomials with coefficients in the ring R forms itself a ring, the ring of polynomials over R, which is denoted by R[''X'']. The map from R to R[''X''] sending r to rX0 is an injective homomorphism of rings, by which R is viewed as a subring of R[''X'']. If R is 
commutative, then R[''X''] is an 
algebra over R.


One can think of the ring R[''X''] as arising from R by adding one new element X to R, and extending in a minimal way to a ring in which X satisfies no other relations than the obligatory ones, plus commutation with all elements of R (that is Xr = rX). To do this, one must add all powers of X and their linear combinations as well.


Formation of the polynomial ring, together with forming factor rings by factoring out 
ideals, are important tools for constructing new rings out of known ones. For instance, the ring (in fact field) of complex numbers, which can be constructed from the polynomial ring R[''X''] over the real numbers by factoring out the ideal of multiples of the polynomial X2 + 1. Another example is the construction of 
finite fields, which proceeds similarly, starting out with the field of integers modulo some 
prime number as the coefficient ring R (see 
modular arithmetic).


If R is 
commutative, then one can associate to every polynomial P in R[X],  a polynomial function f with domain and range equal to R (more generally one can take domain and range to be the same 
unital 
associative algebra over R). One obtains the value f(r) by everywhere replacing the symbol X in P by r. One reason that algebraists distinguish between polynomials and polynomial functions is that over some rings different polynomials may give rise to the same polynomial function (see 




Fermat's little theorem



 for an example where R is the integers modulo p). This is not the case when R is the real or complex numbers and therefore many analysts often don't separate the two concepts. An even more important reason to distinguish between polynomials and polynomial functions is that many operations on polynomials (like 
Euclidean division) require looking at what a polynomial is composed of as an expression rather than evaluating it at some constant value for X. And it should be noted that if R is not commutative, there is no (well behaved) notion of polynomial function at all.




Divisibility


In 
commutative algebra, one major focus of study is divisibility among polynomials. If R is an 
integral domain and f and g are polynomials in R[''X''], it is said that f divides g if there exists a polynomial q in R[''X''] such that f q = g. One can then show that  every zero gives rise to a linear factor , or more formally: if f is a polynomial in R[''X''] and r is an element of R such that f(r) = 0, then the polynomial (X  minus; r) divides f. The converse is also true. The quotient can be computed using the 
Horner scheme.


If F is a 
field and f and g are polynomials in F[''X''] with g   0, then there exist unique polynomials q and r in F[''X''] with 


 f = q \, g + r 

and such that the degree of r is smaller than the degree of g. The polynomials q and r are uniquely determined by f and g. This is called  division with remainder  or  
polynomial long division  and shows that the ring F[''X''] is a 
Euclidean domain.


Analogously, polynomial  primes  (more correctly, 
irreducible polynomials) can be defined which cannot be factorized into the product of two polynomials of lesser 
degree. It is not easy to determine if a given polynomial is irreducible. One can start by simply checking if the polynomial has linear factors. Then, one can check divisibility by some other irreducible polynomials. 
Eisenstein's criterion can also be used in some cases to determine irreducibility.

Classifications



The most important classification of polynomials is based of the number of distinct variables. A polynomial in one variable is called a 
univariate polynomial, a polynomial in more than one variable is called a multivariate polynomial. These notions refer more to the kind of polynomials one is generally working with than to individual polynomials; for instance when working with univariate polynomials one does not exclude constant polynomials (which may result for instance from the subtraction of non-constant polynomials), although strictly speaking constant polynomials do not contain any variables at all. It is possible to further classify multivariate polynomials as bivariate, trivariate etc., according to the number of variables, but this is rarely done; it is more common for instance to say simply  polynomials in x, y, and z . A (usually mulitvariate) polynomial is called homogeneous of degree n if all its terms have degree n.


Univariate polynomials have many properties not shared by multivariate polynomials. For instance, the terms of a univariate polynomial are completely ordered by their degree, and it is conventional to always write them in order of decreasing degree. A univariate polynomial in x of degree n then takes the general form


c_nx^n+c_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots+c_2x^2+c_1x+c_0

where cn, cn-1,  , c2, c1 and c0 are constants, the coefficients of this polynomial. Here the term cnxn is called the leading term and its coefficient cn the leading coefficient; if the leading coefficient is 1, the univariate polynomial is called monic. Note that apart from the leading coefficient cn (which must be non-zero or else the polynomial would not be of degree n) this general form allows for coefficients to be zero; when this happens the corresponding term is zero and may be removed from the sum without changing the polynomial. It is nevertheless common to refer to ci as the coeffient of xi, even when ci happens to be 0, so that xi does not really occur in any term; for instance one can speak of the 
constant term the polynomial, meaning c0 even if it should be zero.


Polynomials can similarly be classified by the kind of constant values allowed as coefficients. One can work with polynomials with integral, rational, real or complex coefficients, and in abstract algebra polynomials with many other types of coefficients can be defined. Like for the previous classification, this is about the coefficients one is generally working with; for instance when working with polynomials with complex coefficients one includes polynomials whose coefficients happen to all be real, even though such polynomials can also be considered to be a polynomials with real coefficients.


Polynomials can further be classified by their degree and/or the number of non-zero terms they contain.

Usually, a polynomial of degree 4 or higher is referred to as a polynomial of degree n, although the phrases quartic polynomial and quintic polynomial are also used. The names for degrees higher than 5 are even less common.  The names for the degrees may be applied to the polynomial or to its terms.  For example, a constant may refer to a zero degree polynomial or to a zero degree term.


The polynomial 0, which may be considered to have no terms at all, is called the zero polynomial. Unlike other constant polynomials, its degree is not zero. Rather the degree of the zero polynomial is either left explicitly undefined, or defined to be negative (either  1 or   )

Euclidean division of polynomials.

The word monomial can be ambiguous, as it is also often used to denote just a power of the variable, or in the multivariate case product of such powers, without any coefficient. Two or more terms which involve the same monomial in the latter sense, in other words which differ only in the value of their coefficients, are called similar terms; they can be combined into a single term by adding their coefficients; if the resulting term has coefficient zero, it may be removed altogether. The above classification according to the number of terms assumes that similar terms have been combined first.




 Polynomials associated to other objects 



Polynomials are frequently used to encode information about some other object. The 
characteristic polynomial of a matrix or linear operator contains information about the operator's 
eigenvalues. The 
minimal polynomial of an 
algebraic element records the simplest algebraic relation satisfied by that element. The 
chromatic polynomial of a 
graph counts the number of proper colourings of that graph.




 Extensions of the concept of a polynomial 



Polynomials can involve more than one variable, in which they are called multivariate. Rings of polynomials in a finite number of variables are of fundamental importance in 
algebraic geometry which studies the simultaneous zero sets of several such multivariate polynomials. These rings can alternatively be constructed by repeating the construction of univariate polynomials with as ceofficient ring another ring of polynomials: thus the ring R[''X'',''Y''] of polynomials in X and Y can be viewed as the ring (R[''X''])[''Y''] of polynomials in Y with as coeffcients polynomials in X, or as the ring 
(R[''Y''])[''X''] of polynomials in X with as coeffcients polynomials in Y. These identifications are compatible with arithmetic operations (they are  
isomorphisms of rings), but some notions such as degree or whether a polynomial is considered monic can change between these points of view. One can construct rings of polynomials in infinitely many variables, but since polynomials are (finite) expressions, any individual polynomial can only contain finitely many variables.



Laurent polynomials are like polynomials, but allow negative powers of the variable(s) to occur.






Rational function


s are formal quotients of polynomials (they are formed from polynomials just as 
rational numbers are formed from 
integers, writing a fraction of two of them; fractions related by the cancelling of common factors are identified with each other). The rational functions contain the Laurent polynomials, but do not limit denominators to be powers of a variable.



Formal power series are like polynomials, but allow infinitely many nonzero terms to occur, so that they do not have finite degree. Unlike polynomials they cannot in general be explicitly and fully written down (just like 
real numbers cannot), but the rules for manipulating their terms are the same as for polynomials.

In 
computer graphics, ray tracing is a technique for generating an 
image by tracing the path of 
light through 
pixels in an 
image plane. The technique is capable of producing a very high degree of 
photorealism; usually higher than that of typical 
scanline rendering methods, but at a greater 
computational cost. This makes ray tracing best suited for applications where the image can be rendered slowly ahead of time, such as in still images and film and television 
special effects, and more poorly suited for real-time applications like 
computer games where speed is critical. Ray tracing is capable of simulating a wide variety of optical effects, such as 
reflection and 
refraction, 
scattering, and 
chromatic aberration.





This recursive ray tracing of a sphere demonstrates the effects of narrow 
depth-of-field, area light sources, 
diffuse interreflection, 
ambient occlusion, and 
fresnel reflection.







Algorithm overview





The ray tracing algorithm builds an image by extending rays into a scene



Optical ray tracing describes a method for producing visual images constructed in 




3D computer graphics



 environments, with more photorealism than either 
ray casting or scanline rendering techniques. It works by tracing a path from an imaginary eye through each pixel in a virtual screen, and calculating the color of the object visible through it. 


Scenes in raytracing are described mathematically by a programmer or by a visual artist (using intermediary tools). Scenes may also incorporate data from images and models captured by means such as digital photography.


Typically, each ray must be tested for intersection with some subset of all the objects in the scene. Once the nearest object has been identified, the algorithm will estimate the incoming light at the point of intersection, examine the material properties of the object, and combine this information to calculate the final color of the pixel. Certain illumination algorithms and reflective or translucent materials may require more rays to be re-cast into the scene.


It may at first seem counterintuitive or  backwards  to send rays away from the camera, rather than into it (as actual light does in reality), but doing so is in fact many orders of magnitude more efficient. Since the overwhelming majority of light rays from a given light source do not make it directly into the viewer's eye, a  forward  simulation could potentially waste a tremendous amount of computation on light paths that are never recorded. A computer simulation that starts by casting rays from the light source is called 
Photon mapping, and it takes much longer than a comparable ray trace.


Therefore, the shortcut taken in raytracing is to presuppose that a given ray intersects the view frame. After either a maximum number of reflections or a ray traveling a certain distance without intersection, the ray ceases to travel and the pixel's value is updated. The light intensity of this pixel is computed using a number of algorithms, which may include the classic rendering algorithm and may also incorporate techniques such as 
radiosity.





Detailed description of ray tracing computer algorithm and its genesis



What happens in nature





Ray tracing can achieve a very high degree of realism



In nature, a light source emits a ray of light which travels, eventually, to a surface that interrupts its progress.  One can think of this  ray  as a stream of 
photons traveling along the same path.  In a perfect vacuum this ray will be a straight line (ignoring 
relativistic effects). In reality, any combination of three things might happen with this light ray:  
absorption, 





reflection




, and 
refraction.  A surface may reflect all or part of the light ray, in one or more directions.  It might also absorb part of the light ray, resulting in a loss of intensity of the reflected and/or refracted light.  If the surface has any 
transparent or 
translucent properties, it refracts a portion of the light beam into itself in a different direction while absorbing some (or all) of the 
spectrum (and possibly altering the color).  Between absorption, reflection, and refraction, all of the incoming light must be accounted for, and no more.  A surface cannot, for instance, reflect 66% of an incoming light ray, and refract 50%, since the two would add up to be 116%.  An exception here is 
fluorescence whereby higher non-visible light frequencies such as UV, which are radiated by many light sources to different degrees, can be converted by some materials to visible light. From here, the reflected and/or refracted rays may strike other surfaces, where their absorptive, refractive, and reflective properties again affect the progress of  the incoming rays.  Some of these rays travel in such a way that they hit our eye, causing us to see the scene and so contribute to the final rendered image.




 Ray casting algorithm 


The first 
ray casting (versus ray tracing) algorithm used for rendering was presented by 
Arthur Appel in 1968. The idea behind ray casting is to shoot rays from the eye, one per pixel, and find the closest object blocking the path of that ray   think of an image as a screen-door, with each square in the screen being a pixel.  This is then the object the eye normally sees through that pixel.  Using the material properties and the effect of the lights in the scene, this algorithm can determine the shading of this object.  The simplifying assumption is made that if a surface faces a light, the light will reach that surface and not be blocked or in shadow.  The shading of the surface is computed using traditional 3D computer graphics shading models.  One important advantage ray casting offered over older 
scanline algorithms is its ability to easily deal with non-planar surfaces and solids, such as 
cones and 
spheres. If a mathematical surface can be intersected by a ray, it can be rendered using ray casting. Elaborate objects can be created by using 
solid modeling techniques and easily rendered.


Ray casting for producing computer graphics was first used by scientists at 


Mathematical Applications Group, Inc.

, (MAGI) of 

Elmsford, New York
, 





New York




. In 1966, the company was created to perform 







radiation exposure






 calculations for the 

Department of Defense
. MAGI's software calculated not only how the 
gamma rays bounced off of surfaces (ray casting for radiation had been done since the 1940s), but also how they penetrated and refracted within.  These studies helped the government to determine certain military applications; constructing military vehicles that would protect troops from radiation, designing re-entry vehicles for space exploration.  Under the direction of Dr. 
Philip Mittelman, the scientists developed a method of generating images using the same basic software. In 1972, MAGI became a commercial animation studio.  This studio used ray casting to generate 3-D computer animation for television commercials, 
educational films, and eventually feature films   they created much of the animation in the film 

Tron
 using ray casting exclusively.  MAGI went out of business in 1985.




 Ray tracing algorithm






The number of reflections a  ray  can take and how it is affected each time it encounters a surface is all controlled via software settings during ray tracing. Here, each ray was allowed to reflect up to 16 times, thus, serial  reflections of reflections  can be seen.





The next important research breakthrough came from 
Turner Whitted in 1979. Previous algorithms cast rays from the eye into the scene, but the rays were traced no further.  Whitted continued the process.  When a ray hits a surface, it could generate up to three new types of rays: reflection, refraction, and shadow.  A reflected ray continues on in the mirror-reflection direction from a shiny surface.  It is then intersected with objects in the scene; the closest object it intersects is what will be seen in the reflection.  Refraction rays traveling through transparent material work similarly, with the addition that a refractive ray could be entering or exiting a material.  To further avoid tracing all rays in a scene, a shadow ray is used to test if a surface is visible to a light.  A ray hits a surface at some point. If the surface at this point faces a light, a ray (to the computer, a line segment) is traced between this intersection point and the light.  If any opaque object is found in between the surface and the light, the surface is in shadow and so the light does not contribute to its shade.  This new layer of ray calculation added more realism to ray traced images.




 Advantages over other rendering methods 


Ray tracing's popularity stems from its basis in a realistic simulation of lighting over other rendering methods (such as scanline rendering or ray casting).  Effects such as reflections and 
shadows, which are difficult to simulate using other algorithms, are a natural result of the ray tracing algorithm.  Relatively simple to implement yet yielding impressive visual results, ray tracing often represents a first foray into graphics programming. The computational independence of each ray makes ray tracing amenable to 
parallelization.




 Disadvantages 


A serious disadvantage of ray tracing is performance. Scanline algorithms and other algorithms use data coherence to share computations between pixels, while ray tracing normally starts the process anew, treating each eye ray separately. However, this separation offers other advantages, such as the ability to shoot more rays as needed to perform 
anti-aliasing and improve image quality where needed. 
Although it does handle interreflection and optical effects such as refraction accurately, traditional ray tracing is also not necessarily photorealistic. True photorealism occurs when the 
rendering equation is closely approximated or fully implemented. Implementing the rendering equation gives true photorealism, as the equation describes every physical effect of light flow. However, this is usually infeasible given the computing resources required. The realism of all rendering methods, then, must be evaluated as an approximation to the equation, and in the case of ray tracing, it is not necessarily the most realistic. Other methods, including 
photon mapping, are based upon ray tracing for certain parts of the algorithm, yet give far better results.




 Reversed direction of traversal of scene by the rays 



The process of shooting rays from the eye to the light source to render an image is sometimes referred to as backwards ray tracing, since it is the opposite direction photons actually travel. However, there is confusion with this terminology. Early ray tracing was always done from the eye, and early researchers such as James Arvo used the term backwards ray tracing to refer to shooting rays from the lights and gathering the results. As such, it is clearer to distinguish eye-based versus light-based ray tracing.


While the direct illumination is generally best sampled using eye-based ray tracing, certain indirect effects can benefit from rays generated from the lights. Caustics are bright patterns caused by the focusing of light off a wide reflective region onto a narrow area of (near-)diffuse surface.  An algorithm that casts rays directly from lights onto reflective objects, tracing their paths to the eye, will better sample this phenomena. This integration of eye-based and light-based rays is often expressed as 
bidirectional path tracing, in which paths are traced from both the eye and lights, and the paths subsequently joined by a connecting ray after some length.12  



Photon mapping is another method that uses both light-based and eye-based ray tracing; in an initial pass, energetic photons are traced along rays from the light source so as to compute an estimate of radiant flux as a function of 3-dimensional space (the eponymous photon map itself). In a subsequent pass, rays are traced from the eye into the scene to determine the visible surfaces, and the photon map is used to estimate the illumination at the visible surface points.34 The advantage of photon mapping versus bidirectional path tracing is the ability to achieve significant reuse of photons, reducing computation, at the cost of statistical bias.  


An additional problem occurs when light must pass through a very narrow aperture to illuminate the scene (consider a darkened room, with a door slightly ajar leading to a brightly-lit room), or a scene in which most points do not have direct line-of-sight to any light source (such as with ceiling-directed light fixtures or torchieres). In such cases, only a very small subset of paths will transport energy; 


Metropolis light transport

 is a method which begins with a random search of the path space, and when energetic paths are found, reuses this information by exploring the nearby space of rays.5

Algorithm: classical recursive ray tracing



For each pixel in image {
Create ray from eyepoint passing through this pixel
Initialize NearestT to INFINITY and NearestObject to NULL


For every object in scene {
If ray intersects this object {
If t of intersection is less than NearestT {
Set NearestT to t of the intersection
Set NearestObject to this object
}
}
}


If NearestObject is NULL {
Fill this pixel with background color
} Else {
Shoot a ray to each light source to check if in shadow
If surface is reflective, generate reflection ray: recurse
If surface is transparent, generate refraction ray: recurse
Use NearestObject and NearestT to compute shading function
Fill this pixel with color result of shading function
}
}





Below is an image showing a simple example of a path of rays recursively generated from the camera (or eye) to the light source using the above algorithm. A diffuse surface reflects light in all directions. 


First, a ray is created at an eyepoint and traced through a pixel and into the scene, where it hits a diffuse surface. From that surface the algorithm recursively generates a reflection ray, which is traced through the scene, where it hits another diffuse surface. Finally, another reflection ray is generated and traced through the scene, where it hits the light source and is absorbed. The color of the pixel now depends on the colors of the first and second diffuse surface and the color of the light emitted from the light source. For example if the light source emitted white light and the two diffuse surfaces were blue, then the resulting color of the pixel is blue.





In real time



The first implementation of a  real-time  ray-tracer was credited at the 2005 





SIGGRAPH




 computer graphics conference as the REMRT/RT tools developed in 1986 by 

Mike Muuss
 for the 

BRL-CAD
 solid modeling system.  Initially published in 1987 at 
USENIX, the BRL-CAD ray-tracer is the first known implementation of a parallel network distributed ray-tracing system that achieved several frames per second in rendering performance.6  This performance was attained by leveraging the highly-optimized yet platform agnostic LIBRT ray-tracing engine in BRL-CAD and by using solid implicit 
CSG geometry on several shared memory parallel machines over a commodity network.  BRL-CAD's ray-tracer, including REMRT/RT tools, continue to be available and developed today as 
Open source software.7


Since then, there have been considerable efforts and research towards implementing ray tracing in real time speeds for a variety of purposes on stand-alone desktop configurations.  These purposes include interactive 3D graphics applications such as 
demoscene productions, 
computer and video games, and image rendering.  Some real-time software 3D engines based on ray tracing have been developed by hobbyist 
demo programmers since the late 1990s.8


The 
OpenRT project includes a highly-optimized software core for ray tracing along with an 

OpenGL
-like API in order to offer an alternative to the current 
rasterisation based approach for interactive 3D graphics.  
Ray tracing hardware, such as the experimental 
Ray Processing Unit developed at the 

Saarland University
, has been designed to accelerate some of the computationally intensive operations of ray tracing.  On 
March 16 
2007, the University of Saarland revealed an implementation of a high-performance ray tracing engine that allowed computer games to be rendered via ray tracing without intensive resource usage.9


On June 12, 2008 Intel demonstrated  running in basic HD (720p) resolution, which is the first time the company was able to render the game using a standard video resolution, instead of 1024 x 1024 or 512 x 512 pixels.  ETQW operated at 14-29 frames per second.  The demonstration ran on a 16-core (4 socket, 4 core) Tigerton system running at 2.93 GHz.10




Example


As a demonstration of the principles involved in raytracing, let us consider how one would find the intersection between a ray and a sphere.  
In 
vector notation, the equation of a sphere with center \mathbf c and radius r is


\left\Vert \mathbf x - \mathbf c \right\Vert^2=r^2.

Any point on a ray starting from point \mathbf s with direction \mathbf d (here \mathbf d is a 
unit vector) can be written as




\mathbf x=\mathbf s+t\mathbf d,


where t is its distance between \mathbf x and \mathbf s.  In our problem, we know \mathbf c,  r, \mathbf s (e.g. the position of a light source) and \mathbf d, and we need to find \mathbf t. Therefore, we substitute for \mathbf x:




\left\Vert\mathbf{s}+t\mathbf{d}-\mathbf{c}\right\Vert^{2}=r^{2}.


Let \mathbf{v}\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \mathbf{s}-\mathbf{c} for simplicity; then




\left\Vert\mathbf{v}+t\mathbf{d}\right\Vert^{2}=r^{2}




\mathbf{v}^2+t^2\mathbf{d}^2+2\mathbf{v}\cdot t\mathbf{d}=r^2




(\mathbf{d}^2)t^2+(2\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{d})t+(\mathbf{v}^2-r^2)=0.


Knowing that d is a unit vector allows us this minor simplification:




t^2+(2\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{d})t+(\mathbf{v}^2-r^2)=0.


This 
quadratic equation has solutions


t=\frac{-(2\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{d})\pm\sqrt{(2\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{d})^2-4(\mathbf{v}^2-r^2)}}{2}=-(\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{d})\pm\sqrt{(\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{d})^2-(\mathbf{v}^2-r^2)}.


The two values of t found by solving this equation are the two ones such that \mathbf \mathbf s+t\mathbf d are the points where the ray intersects the sphere.


If one (or both) of them are negative, then the intersections do not lie on the ray but in the opposite 
half-line (i.e. the one starting from \mathbf s with opposite direction).


If the quantity under the square root ( the 
discriminant )  is negative, then the ray does not intersect the sphere.


Let us suppose now that there is at least a positive solution, and let t be the minimal one. In addition, let us suppose that the sphere is the nearest object on our scene intersecting our ray, and that it is made of a reflective material. We need to find in which direction the light ray is reflected. The laws of 





reflection




 state that the angle of reflection is equal and opposite to the angle of incidence between the incident ray and the 
normal to the sphere.


The normal to the sphere is simply




\mathbf n=\frac{\mathbf y- \mathbf c}{\left\Vert\mathbf y- \mathbf c\right\Vert},


where \mathbf y=\mathbf s+t\mathbf d is the intersection point found before. The reflection direction can be found by a 





reflection




 of \mathbf d with respect to \mathbf n, that is




 \mathbf r = \mathbf d - 2\frac{(\mathbf n \cdot \mathbf d ) \mathbf n}{\left\Vert\mathbf n\right\Vert^2}.


Thus the reflected ray has equation




 \mathbf x = \mathbf y  + t \mathbf r.


Now we only need to compute the intersection of the latter ray with our 
field of view, to get the pixel which our reflected light ray will hit. Lastly, this pixel is set to an appropriate color, taking into account how the color of the original light source and the one of the sphere are combined by the reflection.


This is merely the math behind the 
Line sphere intersection and the subsequent determination of the colour of the pixel being calculated. There is, of course, far more to the general process of raytracing, but this demonstrates an example of the algorithms used.

Smog is a kind of 
air pollution; the word  smog  is a 
portmanteau of 
smoke and 
fog. Classic smog results from large amounts of coal burning in an area caused by a mixture of smoke and 
sulfur dioxide. Modern smog does not usually come from coal but from vehicular and industrial emissions that are  acted on in the atmosphere by sunlight to form secondary pollutants that also combine with the primary emissions to form 
photochemical smog.



 Origin of term 






Smog in 

New York City
 as viewed from the 

World Trade Center
 in 1988



Coinage of the term  smog  is generally attributed to 
Dr. Henry Antoine Des Voeux in his 1905 paper,  Fog and Smoke,  for a meeting of the 
Public Health Congress. The 
26 July 
1905 edition of the London newspaper Daily Graphic quoted Des Voeux,  He said it required no science to see that there was something produced in great cities which was not found in the country, and that was smoky fog, or what was known as  smog.   The following day the newspaper stated that  Dr. Des Voeux did a public service in coining a new word for the London fog. 


 Smog  also appears in a Jan. 19, 1893, Los Angeles Times article and is attributed to  a witty English writer. 




 Photochemical smog 



In the 1950s a new type of smog, known as photochemical smog, was first described. This forms when sunlight hits various pollutants in the air and forms a mix of inimical chemicals that can be very dangerous. A photochemical smog is the chemical reaction of sunlight, 
nitrogen oxides (NOx) and 
volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the atmosphere, which leaves airborne particles (called 
particulate matter) and ground-level 
ozone.


Nitrogen oxides are released by nitrogen and oxygen in the air reacting together under high temperature such as in the exhaust of 
fossil fuel-burning engines in 
cars, trucks, 
coal 
power plants, and industrial manufacturing factories. VOCs are released from man-made sources such as 
gasoline (petrol), 
paints, 
solvents, 
pesticides, and biogenic sources, such as pine and citrus tree emissions.


This noxious mixture of air pollutants can include the following:





 
nitrogen oxides, such as 
nitrogen dioxide


 
tropospheric ozone


 
volatile organic compounds (VOCs)


 
peroxyacyl nitrates (PAN)


 
aldehydes (R'O)




All of these chemicals are usually highly reactive and oxidizing. Photochemical smog is therefore considered to be a problem of modern industrialization. It is present in all modern cities, but it is more common in cities with sunny, warm, dry climates and a large number of motor vehicles.1 Because it travels with the wind, it can affect sparsely populated areas as well.

 Health effects 



Smog is a problem in a number of cities and continues to harm human health.2 
Ground-level ozone, 
sulfur dioxide, 
nitrogen dioxide and 
carbon monoxide are especially harmful for senior citizens, children, and people with heart and lung conditions such as 
emphysema, 
bronchitis, and 
asthma3. It can inflame breathing passages, decreasing the lungs' working capacity, and causing shortness of breath, pain when inhaling deeply, wheezing, and coughing. It can cause eye and nose irritation and it dries out the protective membranes of the nose and throat and interferes with the body's ability to fight infection, increasing susceptibility to illness. Hospital admissions and respiratory deaths often increase during periods when ozone levels are high 4.


The 

U.S. EPA
 has developed an Air Quality index to help explain air pollution levels to the general public. 8 hour average ozone concentrations of 85 to 104 
ppbv are described as  Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups , 105 ppbv to 124 ppbv as  unhealthy  and 125 ppb to 404 ppb as  very unhealthy  
http://www.airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=health2.smog1#4. The  very unhealthy  range for some other pollutants are: 355  g m-3 - 424  g m-3 for 
PM10; 15.5 ppm - 30.4ppm for CO and 0.65 ppm - 1.24 ppm for NO2
http://www.epa.gov/ttn/oarpg/t1/memoranda/rg701.pdf


The 

Ontario Medical Association
 announced that smog is responsible for an estimated 9,500 premature deaths in the province each year.5







 Areas affected 






Smog can form in almost any climate where industries or cities release large amounts of 
air pollution. However, it is worse during periods of warmer, sunnier weather when the upper air is warm enough to inhibit vertical circulation. It is especially prevalent in geologic basins encircled by hills or mountains. It often stays for an extended period of time over densely populated cities or urban areas, such as 

London
, 





New York




, 

Cairo
, 
Los Angeles, 
Sao Paulo, 


Mexico City

, 
Houston, 

Toronto
, 
















Athens















, 

Beijing
, 

Hong Kong
, 

Seoul
, the 




Randstad



 or 
Ruhr Area and can build up to dangerous levels.



 London 








London
 has been known for smog since 



Roman


 times. In 1306, concerns over air pollution were sufficient for 


Edward I

 to (briefly) ban coal fires in London.6 In 1661, 










John Evelyn









's 



Fumifugium


 suggested burning fragrant wood instead of mineral coal, which he believed would reduce coughing. The  the same year describes how the smoke  does our lungs and spirits choke, Our hanging spoil, and rust our iron. 


Severe episodes of smog continued in the 19th century and were nicknamed  pea-soupers . The 






Great Smog of 1952





 darkened the streets of London and killed approximately 4,000 people in the short time of 4 days (a further 8,000 died from its effects in the following weeks and months). Initially a 
flu 
epidemic was blamed for the loss of life. In 1956 the 





Clean Air Act




 introduced 
smokeless zones in the capital. Consequently, reduced 
sulfur dioxide levels made the intense and persistent London smog a thing of the past. It was after this the great clean-up of London began and buildings recovered their original stone facades which, during two centuries, had gradually blackened. Smog caused by traffic pollution, however, does occur in modern London.




 Mexico City 



Due to its location in a highland  bowl , cold air sinks down onto the urban area of 


Mexico City

, trapping industrial and vehicle pollution underneath, and turning it into the most infamous smog-plagued city of Latin America. Within one generation, the city has changed from being known for some of the cleanest air of the world into one with some of the worst pollution, with pollutants like 
nitrogen dioxide being double or even triple international standards.7




 Tehran 



In December 2005, schools and public offices had to close in 

Tehran
, Iran and 1600 people were taken to hospital, in a severe smog blamed largely on unfiltered car exhaust.8




 United States 











The 

United States Environmental Protection Agency
 has designated over 300 U.S. counties to be non-attainment areas for one or more pollutants tracked as part of the 
National Ambient Air Quality Standards.9 These areas are largely clustered around large metropolitan areas, with the largest contiguous non-attainment zones in California and the Northeast. Various U.S. and Canadian government agencies collaborate to produce real-time air quality maps and forecasts.10



Los Angeles



Being in a low basin surrounded by mountains, 
Los Angeles is notorious for its smog. The millions of vehicles in the city due to lack of sufficient 
public transportation and/or to the city's residents' preference for private transportation, plus the added effects of the Los Angeles/

Long Beach
 port complex contribute to further air pollution in the city. While strict regulations by the 

California
n government have reduced the number of Stage 1 smog alerts from several hundred annually to just a few annually, Los Angeles' pollution level still exceeds health standards and is a pressing issue for the more than 15 million people who live there.




 Major incidents in the US 






 1948, October 30-31, Donora, PA: 20 died, 600 hospitalized, thousands more stricken.  Lawsuits were not settled until 1951.11


 1953, November, New York: Smog kills between 170 and 260 people.11


 1954, October, Los Angeles: heavy smog shuts down schools and industry for most of the month.11


 1963, New York: blamed for 200 deaths 12


 1966, New York: blamed for 169 deaths 12








 Southeast Asia 






Smog is a regular problem in 


Southeast Asia

 caused by 
land and forest fires in 

Indonesia
, especially 

Sumatra
 and 
Kalimantan, although the less political term 
haze is preferred in describing the problem. Farmers and plantation owners are usually responsible for the fires, which they use to clear tracts of land for further plantings. Those fires mainly affect 

Brunei
, 

Indonesia
, 

Philippines
, 

Malaysia
, 

Singapore
 and 

Thailand
, and occasionally 

Guam
 and 












Saipan












http://www.saipantribune.com/newsstory.aspx?cat=1 newsID=61706

http://www.sun2surf.com/article.cfm?id=15717 The economic losses of the fires in 1997 have been estimated at US$9.3 billion 
http://www.haze-online.or.id/help/history.php. This includes damages in agriculture production, destruction of forest lands, health, transportation, tourism, and other economic endeavours. Not included are social, environmental, and psychological problems and long-term health effects. The 






latest bout of haze





 to occur in 

Malaysia
, 

Singapore
 and the 
Malacca Straits is in October 2006, and was caused by smoke from fires in 

Indonesia
 being blown across the Straits of Malacca by south-westerly winds.


The 

Association of Southeast Asian Nations
 (ASEAN) reacted and signed 









Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution








, formed a Regional Haze Action Plan (RHAP) and established a 
co-ordination and support unit (CSU). RHAP, with the help of 

Canada
, established a monitoring and warning system for forest/vegetation fires and implemented a Fire Danger Rating System (FDRS). The Malaysian Meteorological Service (MMS) 
http://www.kjc.gov.my/english/service/climate/afdrs/fwi.jpg has issued a daily rating since September 2003.  The Indonesians have been ineffective at enforcing legal policies on errant farmers.




 Natural causes 



An erupting 
volcano can also emit high levels of 
sulfur dioxide, creating volcanic smog, or 
vog.

The severity of smog is often measured using automated optical instruments such  as

s, as haze is associated with visibility and traffic control in ports. Haze however can also be an indication of poor air quality though this is often better reflected using accurate purpose built air indexes such as the American 
Air Quality Index, the Malaysian API (Air Pollution Index) and the Singaporean 
Pollutant Standards Index.


In hazy conditions, it is likely that the index will report the suspended particulate level. The disclosure of the responsible pollutant is mandated in some jurisdictions.





Smog in 
Sao Paulo.



The American AQI is divided into six color coded categories. Technically AQI runs only from 0 to 500. The 301 to 500 range is categorised as hazardous and colored 

maroon
.

http://www.epa.gov/airnow/aqibroch/aqi.html


The Malaysian API does not have a capped value; hence its most hazardous readings can go above 500. Above 500, a state of emergency is declared in the affected area. Usually, this means that non-essential government services are suspended, and all ports in the affected area are closed. There may also be prohibitions on private sector commercial and industrial activities in the affected area excluding the food sector. So far, state of emergency rulings due to hazardous API levels were applied to the Malaysian towns of Port Klang, Kuala Selangor and the state of Sarawak during the 






2005 Malaysian haze





 and the 






1997 Southeast Asian haze





.




 Cultural references 









 The London  pea-soupers  earned the capital the nickname of  The Smoke . Similarly, 

Edinburgh
 was known as  Auld Reekie . The smogs feature in many London novels as a motif indicating hidden danger or a mystery, perhaps most overtly in 


Margery Allingham

's The Tiger in the Smoke (1952), but also in 



Dickens


' 





Bleak House




 (1852):




[A]s he handed me into a fly after superintending the removal of my boxes, I asked him whether there was a great fire anywhere?  For the streets were so full of dense brown smoke that scarcely anything was to be seen. Oh, dear no, miss,  he said.  This is a London particular.  I had never heard of such a thing. A fog, miss,  said the young gentleman.
  



Charles Dickens


, 





Bleak House








 The 1970 
made-for-TV movie A Clear and Present Danger, which featured Hal Holbrook, E.G. Marshall, Joseph Campanella, Jack Albertson and Pat Hingle, was one of the first American television network entertainment programs to warn about the problem of smog and air pollution.13 (This film is not to be confused with the 
1994 film with a similar name.)


 'Smog' or '
Smoggy' has also come into use to describe a resident of 

Teesside
 (in North East England) or a supporter of 
Middlesbrough Football Club, due to the high concentration of chemical and heavy industry in the Teesside area. Although it has now been proven that the Teesside air is cleaner than 

London
, Newcastle, Sunderland and many other British cities, the main source of pollution in the air is now vehicle exhaust fumes, like most urban areas.

Speciation is the 
evolutionary process by which new biological 
species arise. There are four modes of natural speciation, based on the extent to which speciating populations are geographically isolated from one another:  
allopatric, 
peripatric, 
parapatric, and 
sympatric.  Speciation may also be induced artificially, through 
animal husbandry or laboratory experiments. Observed examples of each kind of speciation are provided throughout.1



 Natural speciation 



All forms of natural speciation have taken place over the course of evolution, though it still remains a subject of debate as to the relative importance of each mechanism in driving biodiversity. 2


There is debate as to the rate at which speciation events occur over geologic time.  While some evolutionary biologists claim that speciation events have remained relatively constant over time, some 
palaeontologists such as 









Niles Eldredge








 and 


Stephen Jay Gould

 have argued that species usually remain unchanged over long stretches of time, and that speciation occurs only over relatively brief intervals, a view known as 
punctuated equilibrium.



Allopatric





Comparison of 
allopatric, 
peripatric, 
parapatric and 
sympatric speciation.







Main article: 
allopatric speciation

During allopatric speciation, a population splits into two geographically isolated allopatric populations (for example, by 
habitat fragmentation due to geographical change such as 
mountain building or social change such as 
emigration). The isolated populations then undergo genotypic and/or phenotypic divergence as they (a) become subjected to dissimilar 
selective pressures or (b) they independently undergo 
genetic drift.  When the populations come back into contact, they have evolved such that they are reproductively isolated and are no longer capable of exchanging genes.





Observed instances





Island genetics, the tendency of small, isolated genetic pools to produce unusual traits, has been observed in many circumstances, including 
insular dwarfism and the radical changes among certain famous island chains, like 

Komodo
 and 
Galapagos, the latter having given rise to the modern expression of evolutionary theory, after being observed by 


Charles Darwin

. Perhaps the most famous example of allopatric speciation is Darwin's 







Galapagos Finches






.




Peripatric





Main article: 
peripatric speciation

In peripatric speciation, new species are formed in isolated, small peripheral populations which are prevented from exchanging genes with the main population. It is related to the concept of a 
founder effect, since small populations often undergo bottlenecks. 
Genetic drift is often proposed to play a significant role in peripatric speciation.





Observed instances:







Mayr bird fauna


The Australian bird 
Petroica multicolor


Reproductive isolation occurs in populations of 
Drosophila subject to population bottlenecking




The 
London Underground mosquito is a variant of the mosquito Culex pipiens which entered in the 








London Underground







 in the nineteenth century. Evidence for its speciation include genetic divergence, behavioral differences, and difficulty in mating.3




Parapatric





Main article: 
parapatric speciation

In parapatric speciation, the zones of two diverging populations are separate but do overlap. There is only partial separation afforded by geography, so individuals of each species may come in contact or cross the barrier from time to time, but reduced fitness of the 
heterozygote leads to selection for behaviours or mechanisms which prevent breeding between the two species.


Ecologists refer to parapatric and peripatric speciation in terms of ecological niches.  A 
niche must be available in order for a new species to be successful.

the grass Anthoxanthum has been known to undergo parapatric speciation in such cases as mine contamination of an area.






Sympatric






Main article: 
sympatric speciation

In sympatric speciation, species diverge while inhabiting the same place.  Often cited examples of sympatric speciation are found in insects which become dependent on different 
host plants in the same area. However, the existence of sympatric speciation as a mechanism of speciation is still hotly contested. People have argued that the evidences of sympatric speciation are in fact examples of micro-allopatric, or 
heteropatric speciation. The most widely accepted example of sympatric speciation is that of the cichlids of Lake Nabugabo in East Africa, which is thought to be due to sexual selection.
Sympatric speciation refers to the formation of two or more descendant species from a single ancestral species all occupying the same geographic location.


Until recently, there has a been a dearth of hard evidence that supports this form of speciation, with a general feeling that interbreeding would soon eliminate any genetic differences that might appear. But there has been at least one recent study that suggests that sympatric speciation has occurred in Tennessee cave salamanders. 4


The three-spined sticklebacks, freshwater fishes, that have been studied by Dolph Schluter (who received his Ph.D. for his work on Darwin's finches with Peter Grant) and his current colleagues in British Columbia, provide an intriguing example that is best explained by sympatric speciation.
They have found:





 Two different species of three-spined sticklebacks in each of five different lakes.


 a large benthic species with a large mouth that feeds on large prey in the littoral zone


 a smaller limnetic species   with a smaller mouth   that feeds on the small plankton in open water. 


 DNA analysis indicates that each lake was colonized independently, presumably by a marine ancestor, after the last ice age.


 DNA analysis also shows that the two species in each lake are more closely related to each other than they are to any of the species in the other lakes.


 Nevertheless, the two species in each lake are reproductively isolated; neither mates with the other.


 However, aquarium tests showed that


 the benthic species from one lake will spawn with the benthic species from the other lakes and


 likewise the limnetic species from the different lakes will spawn with each other.


 These benthic and limnetic species even display their mating preferences when presented with sticklebacks from Japanese lakes; that is, a Canadian benthic prefers a Japanese benthic over its close limnetic cousin from its own lake. 


 Their conclusion: in each lake, what began as a single population faced such competition for limited resources that


 disruptive selection   competition favoring fishes at either extreme of body size and mouth size over those nearer the mean   coupled with


 assortative mating   each size preferred mates like it - favored a divergence into two subpopulations exploiting different food in different parts of the lake.


 The fact that this pattern of speciation occurred the same way on three separate occasions suggests strongly that ecological factors in a sympatric population can cause speciation. 




Sympatric speciation driven by ecological factors may also account for the extraordinary diversity of crustaceans living in the depths of Siberia's Lake Baikal. 



Speciation via polyploidization''





Speciation via 
polyploidy: A 
diploid cell undergoes failed 
meiosis, producing diploid 
gametes, which self-fertilize to produce a tetraploid 
zygote.




Polyploidy is a mechanism often attributed to causing some speciation events in 
sympatry. Not all polyploids are reproductively isolated from their parental plants, so an increase in 
chromosome number may not result in the complete cessation of 
gene flow between the incipient polyploids and their parental diploids (see also 
hybrid speciation).


Polyploidy is observed in many species of both plants and animals. In fact, it has been proposed that all of the existing plants and most of the animals are polyploids or have undergone an event of polyploidization in their evolutionary history.




Speciation via hybrid formation''


See 
Hybrid speciation section under the Genetics heading below.





 Reinforcement (Wallace effect) 



Reinforcement is the process by which natural selection increases 
reproductive isolation.5 It may occur after two populations of the same species are separated and then come back into contact. If their reproductive isolation was complete, then they will have already developed into two separate incompatible species.  If their reproductive isolation is incomplete, then further mating between the populations will produce 
hybrids, which may or may not be fertile.  If the hybrids are infertile, or fertile but less fit than their ancestors, then there will be no further reproductive isolation and speciation has essentially occurred (e.g., as in 
horses and 
donkeys.)  The reasoning behind this is that if the parents of the hybrid offspring each have naturally selected traits for their own certain environments, the hybrid offspring will bear traits from both, therefore would not fit either ecological 
niche as well as the parents did. The low fitness of the hybrids would cause selection to favor 
assortative mating, which would control hybridization. This is sometimes called the 
Wallace effect after the evolutionary biologist 


Alfred Russel Wallace

 who suggested in the late 19th century that it might be an important factor in speciation.6 If the hybrid offspring are more fit than their ancestors, then the populations will merge back into the same species within the area they are in contact.



Reinforcement is required for both parapatric and sympatric speciation. Without reinforcement, the geographic area of contact between different forms of the same species, called their  hybrid zone,  will not develop into a boundary between the different species. Hybrid zones are regions where diverged populations meet and interbreed.  Hybrid offspring are very common in these regions, which are usually created by diverged species coming into secondary contact. Without reinforcement the two species would have uncontrollable inbreeding.  Reinforcement may be induced in artificial selection experiments as described below.





Artificial speciation


New species have been created by domesticated 
animal husbandry, but the initial dates and methods of the initiation of such species are not clear. For example, 
domestic sheep were created by hybridisation, and no longer produce viable offspring with 
Ovis orientalis'', one species from which they are descended.7 Domestic 
cattle, on the other hand, can be considered the same species as several varieties of wild 
ox, 
gaur, 
yak, etc., as they readily produce fertile offspring with them.8


The best-documented creations of new species in the laboratory were performed in the late 1980s. William Rice and G.W. Salt bred fruit flies, 
Drosophila melanogaster, using a maze with three different choices of habitat such as light/dark and wet/dry. Each generation was placed into the maze, and the groups of flies which came out of two of the eight exits were set apart to breed with each other in their respective groups. After thirty-five generations, the two groups and their offspring were isolated reproductively because of their strong habitat preferences: they mated only within the areas they preferred, and so did not mate with flies that preferred the other areas. 9


Diane Dodd was also able to show 
allopatric speciation by 
reproductive isolation in Drosophila pseudoobscura fruit flies after only eight generations using different food types, starch and maltose.10 Dodd's experiment has been easy for many others to replicate, including with other kinds of fruit flies and foods.11





The Drosophila experiment conducted by Diane Dodd in 1989.





The history of such attempts is described in Rice and Hostert (1993).12




 Genetics 



 Hybrid speciation 






Main article: 
Hybrid speciation


Hybridization between two different species sometimes leads to a distinct 
phenotype. This phenotype can also be fitter than the parental lineage and as such 
natural selection may then favor these individuals. Eventually, if 
reproductive isolation is achieved, it may lead to a separate species. However, reproductive isolation between hybrids and their parents is particularly difficult to achieve and thus hybrid speciation is considered an extremely rare event. The 
Mariana Mallard arose from hybrid speciation.


Hybridization without change in 
chromosome number is called 
homoploid hybrid speciation. It is considered very rare but has been shown in 
Heliconius 
butterflies 13 and 
sunflowers. 
Polyploid speciation, which involves changes in chromosome number, is a more common phenomena, especially in plant species.




 Gene transposition as a cause 












Theodosius Dobzhansky







, who studied 
fruit flies in the early days of genetic research in 1930s, speculated that parts of chromosomes that switch from one location to another might cause a species to split into two different species. He mapped out how it might be possible for sections of chromosomes to relocate themselves in a 
genome. Those mobile sections can cause sterility in inter-species 
hybrids, which can act as a speciation pressure. In theory, his idea was sound, but scientists long debated whether it actually happened in nature. Eventually a competing theory involving the gradual accumulation of mutations was shown to occur in nature so often that geneticists largely dismissed the moving gene hypothesis.14


However, recent research shows that jumping of a gene from one chromosome to another can contribute to the birth of new species.15 This validates the reproductive isolation mechanism, a key component of speciation.16




 Interspersed repeats 






Main article: 









Interspersed repeat





















Interspersed repetitive DNA sequences








 function as 
isolating mechanisms. These repeats protect newly evolving 
gene sequences from being overwritten by gene conversion, due to the creation of non-homologies between otherwise 
homologous DNA sequences. The non-homologies create barriers to 
gene conversion. This barrier allows nascent novel genes to evolve without being overwritten by the 
progenitors of these genes. This uncoupling allows the evolution of new genes, both within 
gene families and also 
allelic forms of a gene. The importance is that this allows the splitting of a 
gene pool without requiring physical isolation of the organisms harboring those gene sequences.




 Human speciation 



Humans have genetic similarities with 
chimpanzees and 
gorillas, suggesting common ancestors. Analysis of genetic drift and recombination using a 






Markov model





 suggests humans and chimpanzees speciated apart 4.1 million years ago.17

 Plot 


Travis Bickle (De Niro), who claims to be an 
honorably discharged 
Marine   it is implied that he is a Vietnam Veteran   is a lonely and depressed young man of 26. His origins are unknown, although it is likely that he is from the Midwest. He sends his parents cards, lying about his life and saying he works with the Secret Service. He settles in 

Manhattan
 where he becomes a night time 
taxi driver due to 
chronic 
insomnia.1 Bickle spends his restless days in seedy 
porn 
theaters and works 12 or 14 hour shifts during the evening and night time hours carrying passengers among all five 
boroughs of 

New York City
.


Bickle becomes interested in  Betsy  (


Cybill Shepherd

), a campaign volunteer for 
New York Senator  Charles Palantine,  who is running for the presidential nomination and is promising dramatic social change. She is initially intrigued by Bickle and agrees to a date with him after he flirts with her over coffee and sympathizes with her own apparent loneliness. She compares him to a character in the 
Kris Kristofferson song  The Pilgrim.  On their date, however, Bickle is clueless about how to treat a woman and thinks it would be a good idea to take her to a 







Swedish






 
sex education film (

Language of Love
). Offended, she leaves him and takes a taxi home alone. The next day he tries to reconcile with Betsy, phoning her and sending her flowers, but all of his attempts are in vain.1 


Rejected and depressed, Bickle's thoughts begin to turn violent. Disgusted by the petty street crime (especially 
prostitution) that he witnesses while driving through the city, he now finds a focus for his frustration and begins a program of intense physical training. He buys a number of 
pistols from an illegal dealer (Steven Prince) and practices a menacing speech in the mirror, while pulling out a pistol that he attached to a home-made sliding action holster on his right arm  ( 

You talkin' to me?
 ). He develops an ominously intense interest in Senator Palantine's public appearances and it seems that he somehow blames the presidential hopeful for his own failure at wooing Betsy and maybe hopes to include her boss in his growing list of targets.  In an accidental warm-up, Bickle randomly walks into a robbery in a run-down grocery and shoots the robber (Nat Grant) in the face; adding to the bizarre violence, the grocery owner (

Victor Argo
) then proceeds to club the near-dead stickup man with a steel pole.





Alone in his apartment, Bickle postures and practices his moves in front of the mirror.



Bickle is revolted by what he considers the moral decay around him. One night while on shift,  Iris  (



Jodie Foster


), a 12-year-old 
child prostitute, gets in his cab, attempting to escape her 
pimp.1 Shocked by the occurrence Bickle fails to drive off and the pimp,  Sport  (


Harvey Keitel

), reaches the cab. Sport gives Bickle a crumpled twenty dollar bill, which haunts Travis with the memory of his failure to help. Later seeing Iris on the street he pays for her time, although he does not have sex with her and instead tries to convince her to leave this way of life behind. The next day, they meet for 
breakfast and Bickle becomes obsessed with saving this naive child-woman who thinks hanging out with hookers, pimps and drug dealers is more  hip  than dating young boys and going to school. 


Any lingering doubt in the viewer's mind about Bickle's insanity is obliterated when he is suddenly and shockingly shown to be sporting a crude 
Mohawk haircut at a public rally in which he actually attempts to 
assassinate Senator Palantine. He is spotted by 

Secret Service
 men and flees.1 Bickle returns to his apartment, then drives to 





Alphabet City




 where he shoots Sport, before storming into the 
brothel and killing the 
bouncer, Sport (who has followed Bickle), and Iris' 
mafioso customer. He then calmly tries repeatedly to fire a bullet into his own head from under his chin but all the weapons are empty so he resigns himself to resting on a convenient sofa until police arrive on the scene of mayhem and carnage. 


A brief 
epilogue shows Bickle recuperating from the incident. He has received a handwritten letter from Iris' parents who thank him for saving their daughter, and the media hails him as a hero for saving her as well.1 Bickle blithely returns to his job, where one night one of his fares happens to be  Betsy. She comments about his saving of Iris and Bickle's own media fame, yet Bickle denies being any sort of hero. He drops her off without charging her as a nod to her attempt to rekindle their all-too-brief relationship.

Production


In the original draft of the screenplay, writer Paul Schrader had written the role of Sport as a black man. There were also additions of other negative black roles. Scorsese believed that this would give the film an overly racist subtext so they were changed to white roles,2 although the film implies that Travis himself is a racist. Schrader's original screenplay also set the action in Los Angeles; it was moved to New York City because taxis were much more prevalent there than L.A. during the 1970s.


When Bickle determines to assassinate Senator Palantine, he cuts his hair into a 
mohawk. This detail was suggested by actor Victor Magnotta, a friend of Scorsese's who had a small role as a 

Secret Service
 agent and who had served in Vietnam. Scorsese later noted,  Magnotta had talked about certain types of soldiers going into the 
jungle. They cut their hair in a certain way; looked like a mohawk... and you knew that was a special situation, a 
commando kind of situation, and people gave them wide berths ... we thought it was a good idea. 2


Film critic Stephen Hunter's review of the film suggests that one universal assumption in the film, that Travis Bickle is a veteran of the Vietnam War, may not be accurate. Hunter points out how the Bickle character's military clothing and reaction to being around firearms seem incongruous for a combat veteran. Hunter's alternate theory is that Bickle may have been a loner who took up the veteran persona as part of his legion of personal/psychological problems.


While preparing for his role as Travis Bickle, 
Robert De Niro was filming 
Bernardo Bertolucci's 

1900
. According to 


Peter Boyle

, he would  finish shooting on a Friday in Rome...get on a plane from Italy, fly to New York , whereupon he got himself a cab driver's license. He would then go to a garage, pick up a real cab and drive around New York, returning it before he had to depart for Rome again.2
Robert De Niro also acknowledged that while working on Travis' accent, on his days off from shooting 

1900
, he would go to an army base in Northern Italy and tape-record the accents of some of the locals there as he felt they would be good for Travis' character.2


The actress who played Iris' friend in the film was a working prostitute studied by 



Jodie Foster


 to help create her role.2




Controversies





Jodie Foster as  Iris 



The climactic shoot-out was intensely graphic.3 To attain an  R  
rating, Scorsese desaturated the colors, making the brightly-colored blood less prominent.4 In later interviews, Scorsese commented that he was actually pleased by the color change and he considered it an improvement over the originally filmed scene, which has been lost. However, in the special edition DVD, Michael Chapman, the film's cinematographer, regrets the decision and the fact that no print with the unmuted colors exists any more.


Some critics expressed concern over young 



Jodie Foster


's presence during the climactic shoot-out. However, Foster stated that she was present during the setup and staging of the 
special effects used during the scene; the entire process was explained and demonstrated for her, step by step. Rather than being upset or traumatized, Foster said, she was fascinated and entertained by the behind-the-scenes preparation that went into the scene.2 In addition, before being given the part, Foster was subjected to psychological testing to ensure that she would not be emotionally scarred by her role, in accordance with California Labor Board requirements.5




Interpretations of the ending






Roger Ebert


 has written of the film's ending:
 There has been much discussion about the ending, in which we see 
newspaper clippings about Travis's 'heroism' of saving Iris, and then Betsy gets into his cab and seems to give him admiration instead of her earlier disgust. Is this a 
fantasy scene? Did Travis survive the shoot-out? Are we experiencing his dying thoughts? Can the sequence be accepted as literally true? ... I am not sure there can be an answer to these questions. The end sequence plays like 
music, not 
drama: It completes the story on an emotional, not a literal, level. We end not on carnage but on redemption, which is the goal of so many of Scorsese's characters. 6




James Berardinelli
, in his review of the film, argues against the dream or fantasy interpretation, stating: Scorsese and writer Paul Schrader append the perfect conclusion to Taxi Driver. Steeped in irony, the five-minute epilogue underscores the vagaries of fate. The media builds Bickle into a hero, when, had he been a little quicker drawing his gun against Senator Palantine, he would have been revealed as an assassin. As the film closes, the 
misanthrope has been embraced as the model citizen someone who takes on pimps, drug dealers, and mobsters to save one little girl. 7


On the 

Laserdisc
 
audio commentary, Scorsese acknowledged several critics' interpretation on the film's ending being Bickle's dying dream. However, he admitted that the last scene of Bickle glancing at an unseen object implies that he might fall into rage and recklessness in the future, and he is like  a ticking time bomb. 8 Writer Paul Schrader confirms this in his commentary on the 30th anniversary DVD, stating that Travis  is not cured by the movie's end,  and that,  he's not going to be a hero next time. 9




Critical response


Taxi Driver was a financial success earning $28,262,574 in the United States.10 and was nominated for four 
Academy Awards, including Best Picture (but lost to 

Rocky
) and received the 

Palme d'Or
, at the 

Cannes Film Festival
.11 In later years, the film was ranked #52 on the 



American Film Institute


's list of  100 Years, 100 Movies, 12 and #22 on its  100 Years, 100 Thrills. 13 Bickle was also named as #30 on its'  villains  list.14 It has been selected for preservation in the United States 
National Film Registry.15 


The film was chosen by 

Time
 Magazine as one of the 100 best films of all time.16


As of 2008, Rotten Tomatoes reported that 100% of critics gave positive reviews.17

Proposed sequels and spin-offs


In an interview on 
Inside the Actor's Studio in 1999, Robert De Niro stated that he and Martin Scorsese had discussed the possibility of making a sequel to this film. According to De Niro, the two agreed that it would be interesting to see where Travis Bickle ended up 30 years later. But during Scorsese's interview on the show in 2002, the director stated that he would never make a sequel to any of his films.


In May 2005 
Majesco announced that it was going to publish a video game 
sequel to Taxi Driver, developed by 

Papaya Studio
.18 In January 2006 the game was canceled due to financial problems.19




John Hinckley, Jr.


Taxi Driver was reportedly part of a delusional fantasy on the part of 

John Hinckley, Jr.
2021 which triggered his 








attempted assassination







 of President 



Ronald Reagan


 in 
1981, an act for which he was found 
not guilty by reason of insanity.2223 His stated reason was that the act was an attempt to impress 



Jodie Foster


 by mimicking Travis' mohawked appearance at the Palantine rally. The movie was so influential that his attorney concluded his defense by playing the movie.

The Palmer Raids were a series of controversial raids by the 

U.S. Justice
 and 
Immigration 
Departments from 1919 to 1921 on suspected 
radical leftists in the 








United States







. The raids are named for 

Alexander Mitchell Palmer
, 







United States Attorney General






 under 



Woodrow Wilson


. 


Background


The crackdown on radical left-wing political groups had actually begun during 

World War I
.  After a series of bomb attacks of court buildings, police stations, churches and homes attributed to violent immigrant 
anarchist groups, the Department of Justice and its small Bureau of Investigation (BOI) (predecessor to the 
FBI) had begun to track their activities with the approval of President Woodrow Wilson. 


In 1915, Wilson warned of: Hyphenated Americans  (who) have poured the poison of disloyalty into the very arteries of our national life. Such creatures of passion, disloyalty and anarchy must be crushed out.1


Handicapped by the secrecy of these groups and limited Federal law enforcement capabilities, the Bureau of Investigation significantly increased its workload on anarchist movements after 1917 when the Galleanists (followers of 











Luigi Galleani










) and other radical groups commenced a new series of bomb attacks in several major American cities.2345  The 
Russian Revolution of 1917 was also a background factor: many anarchists believed that the worker's revolution there would quickly spread across 
Europe and the United States. 


On 
June 15, 
1917, Congress passed the 




Espionage Act



. The law set punishments for acts of interference in foreign policy and espionage. The act authorized stiff fines and prison terms of up to 20 years for anyone who obstructed the military draft or encouraged  disloyalty  against the U.S. government.  After two anarchist radicals, 

Emma Goldman
 and 

Alexander Berkman
, continued to advocate against 
conscription, Goldman's offices at 

Mother Earth
 were thoroughly searched, and volumes of files and detailed subscription lists from Mother Earth, along with Berkman's journal The Blast, were seized. As a Justice Department news release reported:


A wagon load of anarchist records and propaganda material was seized, and included in the lot is what is believed to be a complete registry of anarchy's friends in the United States. A splendidly kept card index was found, which the Federal agents believe will greatly simplify their task of identifying persons mentioned in the various record books and papers. The subscription lists of Mother Earth and The Blast, which contain 10,000 names, were also seized.



Congress also passed a series of immigration, anti-anarchist, and sedition acts (including the 




Sedition Act of 1918



 and the 
Anarchist Exclusion Act) that sought to either criminalize or punish (through deportation) advocacy of the violent overthrow of the government or desertion from the armed forces, defiance of the draft, or membership in anarchist or revolutionary organizations.  


In 1919, the 

U.S. House of Representatives
 refused to seat 

Socialist
 representative 







Victor L. Berger






 from 





Wisconsin




 because of his socialism, German ancestry, and anti-war views.  


On 
June 2, 
1919, several bombs were detonated by Galleanist anarchists in eight American cities, including one in 

Washington, D.C.
, that damaged the home of newly appointed Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer.  The same bomb detonated near 
Franklin Roosevelt who lived across the street and was walking home with his wife.  Palmer was badly shaken up (the bomber, 
Carlo Valdonoci, was killed by the bomb, which exploded prematurely).6 All of the bombs were delivered with a flyer reading: 


War, Class war, and you were the first to wage it under the cover of the powerful institutions you call order, in the darkness of your laws.  There will have to be bloodshed; we will not dodge; there will have to be murder: we will kill, because it is necessary; there will have to be destruction; we will destroy to rid the world of your tyrannical institutions.7


Palmer, twice the intended victim of assassination, had a personal as well as public motivation to win the battle against the radical left and those preaching violence. 8   After his close calls at the hands of the Galleanists, he appears to have grouped all those identified with the radical left as enemies of the United States.  He stated his belief that Communism was  eating its way into the homes of the American workman,  and that socialists were responsible for most of the country's social problems. 


Calls from the press and a worried public quickly escalated for the federal government to take action against those perpetrating the violence.  Pressure to take action intensified after anarchists, communists and other radical groups called on draft-age males to refuse conscription and/or registration for the army, and for troops already serving to desert the armed forces.  President Wilson ordered Attorney General Palmer to take action.  


At the time, 

Emma Goldman
, 

Alexander Berkman
, and 











Luigi Galleani










 were in the forefront of the anti-conscription movement.  Valdonoci, the Palmer house bomber, was later identified as a militant follower of Luigi Galleani.  Attorney General Palmer requested and received a massive supplementary increase in Congressional appropriations in order to put a stop to the violence.  Palmer then ordered the Department of Justice and the Bureau of Investigation to prepare for what would become known as the Palmer Raids.




Raids


In 1919, 


J. Edgar Hoover

 was put in charge of a new division of the Justice Department's Bureau of Investigation, the General Intelligence Division. By October 1919, Hoover's division had collected 150,000 names in a rapidly expanding index.  Using this information, starting on 
November 7, 
1919, BOI agents, together with local police, orchestrated a series of well-publicized raids against suspected 
radicals and foreigners, using the Espionage Act of 1917 and the Sedition Act of 1918. Palmer and his agents were accused of using torture and other controversial methods of obtaining intelligence and collecting evidence on radicals, including informers and wiretaps.


Victor L. Berger was sentenced to 20 years in prison on a charge of 
sedition, although the 

Supreme Court of the United States
 later overturned that conviction.  The radical anarchist 











Luigi Galleani










 and eight of his Galleanist adherents were deported in June 1919 under the provisons of the 
Anarchist Exclusion Act, three weeks after the 
June 2 wave of bombings. Although authorities did not have enough evidence to arrest Galleani for the bombings, they could deport him because he was a resident alien who had overtly encouraged the violent overthrow of the government, was a known associate of 
Carlo Valdonoci and had authored an explicit how-to bomb making manual titled La Salute e in Voi (The Health is Within You), used by other Galleanists to construct some of their package bombs.


In December 1919, Palmer's agents gathered 249 people of Russian origin, including well-known radical leaders such as 

Emma Goldman
 and 

Alexander Berkman
, and placed them on a ship bound for the 



Soviet Union


 (
The Buford, called the Soviet 
Ark by the 
press). In January 1920, another 6,000 were arrested, mostly members of the 

Industrial Workers of the World
 union. During one of the raids, more than 4,000 individuals were rounded up in a single night.  By January 1920, Palmer and the Department of Justice had organized the largest mass arrests in U.S. history, rounding up at least 10,000 individuals.



Louis Freeland Post, then Assistant Secretary of Labor, 9 cancelled more than 2000 of these warrants as being illegal.10 Of the many thousands arrested, 556 people were eventually deported under the 1918 Anarchist Act.11


For most of 1919 and early 1920, much of the public sided with Palmer, but this soon changed. Palmer announced that an attempted Communist revolution was certain to take place in the U.S. on 
May 1 
1920 (













May Day












).  No such revolution took place on May 1, leading to criticism of Palmer.12  However, on September 16 of that year the 

Wall Street bombing
 by Galleanist anarchists killed thirty-eight persons and wounded 400; it was the deadliest bombing attack to date in the United States.  


On May 28, 1920, the 

American Civil Liberties Union
 published a report entitled Report of the Illegal Practices of the United States Department of Justice which carefully documented unlawful Departmental authorization of the arrests of suspected radicals, illegal entrapment by agent provocateurs and unlawful incommunicado detention.  The report was signed by prominent lawyers and law professors, including 

Felix Frankfurter
, 

Roscoe Pound
 and 





Ernst Freund




.  Palmer was called before the House Rules Committee and strongly defended his actions and that of his department, saying  I apologize for nothing that the Department of Justice has done in this matter.  I glory in it. 1314 


In June 1920, Judge 


George Anderson

 effectively ended the raids when he ordered the discharge of twenty aliens, and denounced Department of Justice actions.  The discovery of trumped-up charges and the 








Daugherty-Burns







 scandal turned public opinion against further large-scale arrests and searches, though 

subsequent bomb attacks
 and public clamor to punish the radicals believed responsible did not subside.1516  Palmer, once seen as a likely presidential candidate, lost the 
nomination.  For their part, the Galleanists continued their violent bombing campaign, which would last another twelve years.17

Date-time group (DTG):  In a 
message, a 
set of characters, usually in a prescribed 
format, used to express the year, the month, the day of the month, the hour of the day, the minute of the hour and the 
time zone (if different from Zero zone or UTC+0). The order may vary, for example,  21:52 Feb 20, 2003 (UTC) .
DTG used within military record traffic messages has traditionally used the format  271545Z FEB 08  to represent 1545 hours (ZULU or UTC), on the 27th of February 2008.

Note 1:  The DTG is usually placed in the 
header of the message. 


Note 2:  The DTG may be used as a message 
identifier if it is unique for each message. 


Note 3:  The DTG may indicate either the 
date and time a message was dispatched by a transmitting station or the date and time it was handed into a 
transmission 
facility by a 
user or originator for dispatch.
