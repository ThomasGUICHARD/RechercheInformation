200,000 participants. The march, demonstration and rally also included the first public display of Cleve Jones' 





NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt




 and the first community Wedding.




The 200,000 person estimate, widely quoted from the New York Times, was made several hours before the march actually began; similarly, most of the pictures used by mainstream media were taken early in the morning, or of the AIDS Quilt viewing area rather than the march itself. Police on the scene estimated numbers during the actual march to be closer to half a million.


This event   date would also become the starting point for what would become 

National Coming Out Day
.


1987 March on Washington History/Background


The march began with a grassroots call out to known lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender organizations for an organizational/platform meeting in New York City in November 1986. Steve Ault   Robin Tyler, both of whom had been active in the first march in 1979, felt that the time had arrived for another March on Washington. Representatives from the following schools were in attendance: Brown University; California Institute of Technology; California State Universities at Dominguez Hills, Fullerton, Long Beach, Los Angeles, Northridge, San Francisco; CUNY Hunter College, Queens College; New York University; Pasadena City College, Stanford University, University of California at Los Angeles; and University of Southern California. At the end of the weekend, the overall structure for the National Steering Committee had been set, a gender parity Co-Chair structure (Robin Tyler and Steven Ault) with the usual organizational positions; Stephen G. (check spelling), Secretary (Brown University); and additional Regional (California; Nicole Ramirez-Murray    and Issues/Constituent-related Chairs for organization and special interest input.


The second meeting of the steering committee was held in January 1987 in the City of West Hollywood at City Hall. Jean Conger from Southern California Women for Understanding was the parliamentarian for the meeting. Among of the issues discussed were  the personal is political,  (Rosie O Donnell still uses this phrase -  The View  04.03.07) and a petition for adding atheists to the list of peoples represented.

The 
Ky sh  J7W1 Shinden (  ,  Magnificent Lightning ) 
fighter was a 







World War II






 
Japanese propeller driven aircraft 
prototype that was built in a 
canard design. The wings were attached to the tail section and stabilizers were on the front. The propeller was also in the rear, in a 
pusher configuration. It was expected to be a highly maneuverable interceptor, but only two were finished before the end of war. Plans were also drawn up for a 
jet-powered version (J7W2 Shinden Kai), but this never left the drawing board.



Design and development



The J7W was developed for the 

Imperial Japanese Navy
 as a specific response to the 

B-29 Superfortress
 raids on the Japanese homeland. It was to be operated from land bases. The canard concept was tested first by building a number of gliders with this layout, designated 
MXY6.


The first prototype, the only one to have flown, is currently in storage at the 
National Air and Space Museum.

GNU project software




GNU Sharutils is a set of utilities to handle 
shell archives. The GNU shar utility produces a single 
file out of many files and prepares them for transmission by 
electronic mail services, for example by converting 
binary files into plain 





ASCII




 text. A shell archive is a collection of files that can be unpacked by the 



Bourne shell


. A wide range of features provide extensive flexibility in manufacturing shar archives and in specifying shar smartness. For example, shar may 
compress files, 
uuencode binary files, split long files and construct multi-part mailings, ensure correct unsharing order, and provide 
md5sum or byte count verification.

GNU unshar scans a set of mail messages looking for the start of shell archives. It will automatically strip off the mail headers and other introductory text. The archive bodies are then unpacked by a copy of the shell. unshar may also process files containing concatenated shell archives.

Information



Nationality





Ryu Hayabusa (        , Ry  Hayabusa) is the protagonist and the 
player character of the 
Ninja Gaiden series



 Personality 


Ryu has the demeanor and wisdom of a man far older than himself, due to his prolific lineage and mantle of station as a respected ninja. His exploits have given him an attitude far removed from most others, and he understands things in more abstract and philosophical terms. Much like 


Gen Fu

 and 


Eliot

, he adopts a tranquil nature, much akin to water; free flowing most of the time, but unforgiving and crushing when roused. Through the Dead or Alive tournament, he has extricated himself from many of the subplots involving other characters, concentrating instead purely on the larger goals that present themselves. 


He is 


Hayate

's best friend and an ally of 


Kasumi

 and 


Ayane

. He and his ninja brethren have been direct players in the defeat of every major threat in the D.O.A. tournaments, himself defeating the rogue 






Tengu





 in single combat during the second tournament. Ryu has befriended several people from the DOA tournaments, notably 


Jann Lee

, with whom he shares a mutual respect.


In Ninja Gaiden, Ryu is acquainted with female protagonists like Rachel and Irene. On the other hand, Ryu has been betrayed by some of his allies such as Foster (NG III: The Ancient Ship of Doom) and Murai (NG Xbox).




Game history


Ryu first appeared in the 
Ninja Gaiden 
beat 'em up 
arcade game in 1988. In that same year, Ninja Gaiden was released on the 

NES
 (Famicom, in Japan) and the 

Sega Master System
, though these versions, being more centered around 





platformer




-style gameplay, bore little resemblance to the original arcade game.  Two NES sequels,  and , followed in 1990 and 1991 to complete the trilogy. Also in 1991, Ninja Gaiden Shadow was released on the 

Game Boy
. Ryu's next few appearances were as a playable fighter in the Dead or Alive series, which saw releases on the 






PlayStation





, 

Sega Saturn
, 

Dreamcast
, 

PlayStation 2
, 

Xbox
 and 

Xbox 360
 platforms, as well as in 
arcades.


There is no story to the original arcade version of Ninja Gaiden, except that Ryu and an unnamed red ninja sidekick who serves as the second player were beating up their foes throughout the 








United States







. Ryu's story commences in Ninja Gaiden for the NES, when he receives a letter from his father, who has departed to fight a life or death duel. Players are left to guess as the story progresses throughout the game, as the young Hayabusa goes on his quest for revenge and to uncover the truth behind his father's disappearance. This was followed by the next two games of the trilogy, which have mysterious introductions that unfolded in a similar manner. In Ninja Gaiden II, players are introduced to a new villain who wields the Dark Sword of Chaos. In Ninja Gaiden III, Ryu Hayabusa is framed for killing his girlfriend.  


Eventually, Ryu moved from Ninja Gaiden to 

Tecmo
's Dead or Alive series. Taking place chronologically years after his exploits in the Ninja Gaiden series, he adopts a new, sleeker look. His story is fleshed out more, as a new ninja clan is introduced, several other supporting characters, and a new, serpentine plot that he finds himself intertwined in. He has been a participant in every DOA tournament, canonically winning the second tournament by killing Tengu. His cohorts have claimed the other contests.


Finally, after the long wait, Ryu returned to 
Ninja Gaiden for the 

Xbox
, in a 3D 
action game with new and original gameplay. The prologue explains the 
Mythos of the 
Dragon Lineage who sided with the Dragons against the Evil Deities and the Tribes, and how they slew the Dark Dragon.  The Dragons are described as god-like, benevolent creatures with metallic bones, teeth and claws, created by the Deity of Creation to counter the Evil Deities. The prologue includes a brief history of the two Dragon Swords. The first is the Dark Dragon Blade, carved out of the bone of the legendary Dark Dragon that betrayed his brethren out of jealousy and thirst for power, joining the Evil Deities. This blade consumes evil, charging as more evil is committed in its vicinity. As a result, the weapon turns its wielder into the devil incarnate.  The second sword is the Dragon Sword, carved from the fang of the Dragon, and bequeathed the 
Dragon Lineage from generation to generation, and finally to Ryu Hayabusa. It is the same sword used by Ryu in the NES Ninja Gaiden trilogy.


The story of Ninja Gaiden (Xbox) deviated from the original NES Ninja Gaiden Trilogy by a few small 
retroactive continuities. Ninja Gaiden (Xbox) and it's sequels Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword and Ninja Gaiden 2 serve as 
prequels to the NES Ninja Gaiden series, both series are connected to the Dead or Alive series.  Timeline wise the events the current Ninja Gaiden series happen first, then the NES Ninja Gaiden series, and finally the Dead or Alive series. 1




Ninja Gaiden



Before Ninja Gaiden


Ryu bears the name 'Hayabusa' when he graduated the Hayabusa School. He's the son of Joe Hayabusa and he's a member of his father's clan called the Hayabusa Ninja Clan. 
His mother was neither mentioned nor seen in any NG games. 
He has mastered everything he learned from his school, much to the delight of his father. 
He has earned the title 'Super Ninja'.










Ninja Gaiden (NES)







Ryu received a letter from his father, 
Joe Hayabusa, that said he had a duel to the death with another ninja. Ryu then prepared a keepsake sword he'd gotten from his father, the Dragon Sword, and went in search of his father. During his adventure, he met up with Irene Lew and faced the man who dueled his father, 
Bloody Malth, before being reunited with his father. However, Joe was killed by Bloody Malth's master, the 
Jaquio. Ryu avenged his father's death by killing Jaquio and also the Demon god.







Ashtar, Jaquio's master and the Emperor of Darkness, had planned to rule the world with the power of the Demon.  With the Demon dead, Ashtar kidnaps Irene to lure Ryu to his home dimension.  Ashtar wields the Dark Sword of Chaos, made from the Bone of the Demon at the same time that the Dragon Sword was forged from the Fang of the Dragon.  Ryu eventually confronts and defeats Ashtar, but before he can get Irene to safety, she is captured by Jaquio, who now bears the Dark Sword.  Ryu confronts and defeats the Jaquio a second time at an altar made from the Demon's bones.  However, the Jaquio's blood flows into the Dark Sword, awakening it. The Jaquio is revived by its power, and stabs Irene with the sword.  Ryu slays the Jaquio again, but Irene's blood empowers the sword further, and revives the Demon.  Ryu fights the Demon again in a battle similar to the one in 
Ninja Gaiden.  After Ryu kills the Demon again, the Dark Sword of Chaos shatters, and he carries Irene back to Earth, where she succumbs to her wounds and dies.  Crying over her body, Ryu calls on the spirits of his ancestors, saying his victories are meaningless without her.  The Dragon Sword then begins to hum and glow, emitting a blue light which flows into Irene, reviving her.  The couple then watches the evening sunset (unlike the sunrise in the other two NES Ninja Gaiden games).






A Ryu 
doppelganger assassinates Irene and frames the original for murder. During his quest to clear his name, Ryu discovers that Irene is still alive and that his doppelganger was a BIO-NOID sent by Irene's own boss and former acquaintance of his, Foster. This was followed by an engagement with Ryu's doppelganger which ended in Ryu's defeat. But in their second encounter, Ryu turns the tables, defeating his doppelganger instead. But in a shocking turn-of-events, Foster is double-crossed by his accomplice, Clancy, who murders him. Clancy reveals the true nature of their location, the Castle Rock Fortress, as an inter-dimensional warship, which he intends to use for global dominance. With both Irene and himself caught up in Clancy's machinations, Ryu is forced to take action. Subsequently, Ryu foils Clancy's plans and flees the crumbling Castle Rock Fortress with Irene.





Ninja Gaiden (Xbox)


The Hayabusa Ninja Clan was annihilated including Ryu's childhood friend Kureha, and the Dark Dragon Blade was stolen by the evil black samurai Doku, the Lord of the Greater Fiends, and his minions. Though killed by Doku, Ryu was revived by the clan's animal spirit, the falcon and goes on a journey in search of the stolen Dark Dragon Blade and avenge his clan's death. As he proceeded, he met the Fiend Hunter Rachel, who was in search of her sister. He was observed by Gamov and a mysterious associate of his, known only as the Dark Disciple. Ryu also came across Rachel's twin sister Alma, who was morphed into a Fiend. Eventually, Alma saved Rachel from Doku and Doku was defeated by Hayabusa. Ryu defeated the Vigoor Emperor and the Fiends and retrieved the evil blade. Ryu and Rachel came across two  observers  but Gamov was betrayed and killed by his own associate who was wielding the Dark Dragon Blade. The Dark Disciple was later revealed to be an ally of Ryu, Murai. Murai then betrayed him and challenged him. Despite wielding the evil blade, Murai was defeated and Ryu destroyed the sword. He then left Rachel with no further comment and brought back the Dragon Eye he got from Kureha's grave.







The story of Ninja Gaiden Dragon Sword takes place six months after the events of Ninja Gaiden (Xbox). A female ninja named Momiji makes her first appearance in the Ninja Gaiden series. The story begins as Momiji is kidnapped by the  Black Spider clan led by Obaba, an elderly woman. Ryu sets out to find seven Dark Dragonstones, defeating several bosses along the way. At the climax of the adventure, Ishtaros, (an ancient Fiend, who is said to have ruled over the land along with her sister, Nicchae) steals the dragonstones from Ryu, making her stronger, and making Ryu's sword weak and useless. Ryu is quickly defeated by Ishtaros, but when Kureha, Momiji's sister, appears and fuses with Momiji's Dragon Eye, the Dragon sword becomes the True Dragon Sword once again. Once Ryu defeats Ishtaros, he must meet with Muramusa (the old man who sells wares to people in Hayabusa Village) then, after defeating the rest of the Black Spider ninja's, he meets up with Nicchae, who tried to fuse Ishtaros together with the dragonstones. The process goes awry, and after Ryu fights with Nicchae, she accepts her fate and is drawn into the cocoon with her sister, warning Ryu of what is yet to come, something she even fears. With this, Ryu must fight the final boss in the game, a dragon which emerged from Ishtaros' cocoon. When Ryu defeats the dragon, he brings Momiji back home. All of the Hayabusa Village mourn at Kureha's grave and Momiji once again starts training with Ryu, hoping to fulfill her promise to her sister to become stronger.





Ninja Gaiden II (Xbox 360)


The story begins with Sonia, a CIA agent, asking Muramasa if he knows the whereabouts of Ryu Hayabusa, telling him that she has information concerning the Archfiend. Before long, the store is attacked by the Black Spider Clan. Ryu arrives in the nick of time, but is unable to save her and she is kidnapped. He eventually finds her after travelling through the skylines of Tokyo, whereby she warns him of the plot of the greater fiends to steal the Demon Statue, which is being protected by the Hayabusa Ninja Village, in order to resurrect the Archfiend. 


The Hayabusa Ninja Clan, who protect the Demon Statue, are now in grave danger. Informed by Sonia, Ryu heads back to the village to see it burning once again. Fighting his way to the Castle of the Dragon where the Statue is held, he finds his father, Joe, fighting Genshin, leader of the Black Spider Clan. They are unable to stop the statue being stolen by Elizebet - one of the greater fiends - and so Ryu follows her trail in the hope of retrieving the statue. Defeating all four greater fiends along the way and later Genshin, Ryu is unable to stop the resurrection of the Archfiend. However, he ultimately destroys it before it can escape. In the aftermath, Ryu reunites with Sonia, and is last seen placing Genshin's sword among many others in a field as a symbol of his grave.






Dead or Alive



Before Dead or Alive


Ryu had some adventures with his love interest 
Irene Lew and is a member of his father's clan, the Hayabusa Ninja Clan. He's also best friends with the Mugen Tenshin ninja 


Hayate

 and became acquainted with his friend's clan. He's also acquainted with Hayate's sister Kasumi and half-sister Ayane. After the events of Ninja Gaiden for NES, as chronicled in the Ninja Gaiden OVA, he moved to America where he married Irene and bought an antique shop he ran with her.





Dead or Alive


One day, Ryu heard that 


Kasumi

's brother 


Hayate

 disappeared. He also heard that she joined the DOA Tournament so he joined the tournament as well.














Dead or Alive 2











Ryu joined the 2nd DOA Tournament because he was informed by his own clan that a creature from another dimension named 






Tengu





 joined the tournament to create chaos in the world. Eventually, Ryu came across his lost friend 


Hayate

 (as Ein and was still suffering from a memory loss) and defeated him, restoring his memory. Ryu then defeated 






Tengu





 to save the world from his evil plot and won the second tournament.














Dead or Alive 3














Genra

 was captured by 
DOATEC and became a superhuman known as  Omega.  In the tournament, Hayabusa faces off against Hayate, who became the 18th leader of the Mugen Tenshin Ninja Clan after recovering from a memory loss. In his CG ending, he receives a letter from an unknown ninja while he's fishing near the river. It is not known what is said on this letter but it might have something to do with the plans to attack DOATEC in DOA4 from Ayane and Hayate, whom would need his assistance.














Dead or Alive 4











Ryu joins Hayate, Kasumi and 


Ayane

 to stop DOATEC. Ryu and Ayane come across with 


Christie

, who is trying to stop the ninjas from destroying the DOATEC Tritower. In his CG ending, He destroys three DOATEC special aircraft, first by making it self destruct, second by a slash of his sword into two and the last with a ninpo attack (possibly the Art of the Piercing Void) he produced from his palms before disappearing into the night. He produces another ninpo attack in 


Helena

's CG ending onto a single chopper to destroy it, showing a man trapped inside the aircraft who could have been 
Donovan.


Moreover, Ryu appears in Kasumi's and Ayane's DOA4 story mode but not as an opponent. He's an opponent in Jann Lee's and Christie's DOA4 story mode (in Christie's story mode, she faces either Ryu or Ayane randomly).

A function pointer is a type of 
pointer in 

C
, 

C++
, 
D, and other C-like programming languages. When 
dereferenced, a function pointer invokes a 
function, passing it zero or more arguments just like a normal function. In programming languages like C, function pointers can be used to simplify code by providing a simple way to select a function to execute based on run-time values.


Function objects, or functors, are similar to function pointers, and can be used in similar ways. A functor is an object of a class type that implements the function-call operator, allowing the object to be used within expressions using the same syntax as a function call. Functors are more powerful than simple function pointers, being able to contain their own data values, and allowing the programmer to emulate 
closures, among other uses.


Many  pure  object-oriented languages (such as 


Java

) do not support function pointers. Something similar can be implemented in these kinds of languages, though, using 
references to 
interfaces that define a single 
member function. 
Microsoft .NET languages such as 

C#
 and 

Visual Basic .NET
 implement 
type-safe function pointers with 
delegates.


In other languages that support 
first-class functions, functions are regarded as data, and can be passed, returned, and created dynamically directly by other functions, eliminating the need for function pointers.


Extensively using function pointers to call functions may produce a slow-down for the code on modern processors, because 
branch prediction may not be able to figure out where to branch to (it depends on the value of the function pointer at run time) although this effect can be overstated as it is often amply compensated for by significantly reduced non indexed table lookups.



 Examples in C 


This example demonstrates the use of function pointers. Here a function pointer func is declared, the address of the function named myfunc() is assigned to it, and then the function is invoked by dereferencing the pointer.






include 




static int myfunc(int a)
{
printf( myfunc: %d\n , a);
return (2*a + 3);
}


int main(void)
{
int (*func)(int) = myfunc;
int  x;


x = (*func)(10);
printf( main: %d\n , x);
return 0;
}



Note that the syntax (*fp)(arg) is used to invoke the function indirectly through function pointer fp. C syntax also allows the simpler fp(arg) to be used, since the fp subexpression evaluates to the address of a function whether it is a function name or a pointer to a function.


The next example shows how function pointers can be used as parameters to other functions. As  in the previous example, a function named function() is defined which will be called through a function pointer. A function named caller() accepts as parameters a function pointer and an integer, which will be passed as arguments to the function that will be called by caller(). The first parameter of caller may be a pointer to any function whose prototype matches the prototype of the argument func.






include 




static void function(int a)
{
printf( function: %d\n , a);
}


static void caller(void (*func)(int), int p)
{
(*func)(p);
}


int main(void)
{
caller(function, 10);
return 0;
}



This third example shows how function pointers can be used as parameters to other functions. Here a function f() is passed to function integ() which approximates an 
integral evaluated over an interval, \textstyle\int_{a}^{b} f(x)\;dx, calling the function f(x) for each value of x. Any function taking a single double argument and returning a double result can be passed to integ() for evaluation.



double integ(double a, double b, double (*f)(double))
{
double sum = 0.0;
int n;


// Evaluate integral{a,b} f(x) dx
for (n = 0; n = 100; ++n) {
double x = a + n*(b-a)/100.0;
sum += (*f)(x) * (b-a)/101.0;
}
return sum;
}



For defining an array of function pointers, it might be useful to use a 
typedef to declare a new type for your function pointer.






include 


include 




typedef double (*Fx)(double);


int main(void)
{
Fx f[3];   /* or equivalently:  double (*f[3])(double); */


f[0] = cos;
f[1] = sin;
f[2] = tan;


printf( From 0 to pi/4:\n );
printf( \t integ of cos = %g\n , integ(0, M_PI/4, f[0]));
printf( \t integ of sin = %g\n , integ(0, M_PI/4, f[1]));
printf( \t integ of tan = %g\n , integ(0, M_PI/4, f[2]));


return 0;
}





Method pointers


C++ is 
object-oriented, so classes can have 
methods. Non-static member functions (instance methods) have an implicit parameter (the 
this pointer) which is the pointer to the object it is operating on, so the type of the object must be included as part of the type of the function pointer. The method is then used on an object of that class by using one of the  pointer-to-member  operators: .* or - gt;* (for an object or a pointer to object, respectively).






include 




class Adder
{
int x;
public:
Adder(int in) : x(in) { }
int addx(int y) { return x + y; }
};


int main()
{
int (Adder::*func)(int) =  Adder::addx;
Adder foo = Adder(3);
std::cout  (foo.*func)(5)  std::endl; // prints  8 
return 0;
}



Although function pointers in C and C++ can be implemented as simple addresses, so that typically sizeof(Fx)==sizeof(void *), member pointers in C++ must be implemented as  fat pointers , typically two or three times the size of a simple function pointer, in order to deal with 
virtual inheritance (see also 
virtual function).

Phosphocreatine, also known as creatine phosphate or Pcr, is a 
phosphorylated 
creatine molecule that is an important energy store in skeletal 
muscle. It is used to 
anaerobically generate 
ATP from 
ADP, forming 
creatine for the 2 to 7 seconds following an intense effort.  It does that by donating a phosphate group and this reaction is catalyzed by 
creatine kinase (presence of creatine kinase in 
plasma is indicative of tissue damage and is used in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction). This reaction is reversible and it therefore acts as a spatial and temporal buffer of ATP concentration. In other words, phosphocreatine is part of a coupled reaction; the energy given off from one reaction is used to regenerate the other compound - be it ATP. Phosphocreatine plays a particularly important role in tissues that have high, fluctuating energy demands such as muscle and brain.

Creatine phosphate is a high-energy phosphate-storage compound (phosphagen) found in muscles; formed from parts of three amino acids: 
Arg, Gly, and Met; biosynthesis: formation of quanidinoacetate from Arg and Gly (in kidney) followed by methylation (S-adenosyl methionine, SAM is required) to creatine (in liver), and phosphorylation by creatine kinase (ATP is required) to creatine phosphate (in muscle); catabolism: dehydratation to 
creatinine. is synthesized in the 
liver, and transported to the muscle cells, via the bloodstream, for storage.

Baronies




Baron Leconfield, of Leconfield in the East Riding of the County of York, is a title in the 







Peerage of the United Kingdom






. It was created in 1859 for 

George Wyndham
. He was the eldest natural son and adopted heir of 
George O'Brien Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont (see the 




Earl of Egremont



 for earlier history of the family). His eldest son, the second Baron, represented 






West Sussex





 in the 
House of Commons as a 

Conservative
. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the third Baron, who served as 







Lord Lieutenant of Sussex






 from 1917 to 1949. The latter's nephew, the sixth Baron, served as Private Secretary to Prime Minister 

Harold Macmillan
 from 1957 to 1963. In 1963, four years before he succeeded his father in the barony of Leconfield, the Egremont title held by his ancestors was revived when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Egremont, of Petworth in the County of Sussex. As of 2007 the titles are held by his son, the seventh Baron. Known as Max Egremont, he is a biographer and novelist.

The Hon. 









Percy Wyndham








, younger son of the first Baron, was a Conservative politician and member of 
The Souls. He was the father of the

Elliott Roosevelt (
September 23, 
1910   
October 27, 
1990) was an 








United States







 
Army Air Corps officer and an author. He was also the son of 

U.S. President
 



Franklin D. Roosevelt


 (FDR) and First Lady 
Anna Eleanor Roosevelt.



Early life


Elliott Roosevelt was the fourth of Franklin and Eleanor's six children, their third child having died in infancy about a year before Elliott's birth. He was named after his grandfather, Elliott Roosevelt. His siblings who reached adulthood were 
Anna Eleanor Roosevelt, 
James Roosevelt, 
Franklin Roosevelt and 
John Aspinwall Roosevelt. 
Sara Delano Roosevelt, Elliott's grandmother, hired her grandchildren's nannies, interfered with their raising, and told both Eleanor and the children that Eleanor was  only the one who bore you: I am your real mother. 


Elliott Roosevelt was a 





bombardier




 in the 

United States Army Air Forces
 (USAAF) during World War II. He flew a 
P-38 Lightning in the 
North African campaign of November 1942. In 1944, he witnessed the death of 

Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr.
 over 





Blythburgh




, England. Roosevelt attained the rank of Brigadier General in 1945, causing some controversy as virtually all others who had made general in the Army Air Corps before him had been pilots.  


During 







World War II






, he accompanied FDR as a 
Military attache to the 
Casablanca meeting and the subsequent 





Cairo




 and 





Tehran Conference




s. At the Tehran Conference, Elliott Roosevelt, apparently under the influence of alcohol, sided with his father in approving of large-scale executions of German POWs by the Soviets. (Montefiore 469-70). As an Army photo reconnaissance pilot, he and the men in his unit also played a key role in the 
D-Day landings.




Vasily Stalin


Elliot Roosevelt and 
Vasily Stalin had a great deal in common. While at the 





Tehran Conference




, 
Stalin had especailly invited Elliot to a banquet he was hosting at the Soviet Compound, perhaps he sensed the similarity with his own scapegrace son, Vasily. Both were pilots, inadequate yet arrogant drunks who were intimiddated and dominated by brilliant fathers. Both exploited the family name and embarrassed their fathers. Both failed in multiple marriges and abondoned their wives. Perhaps there is no sadder curse than the gift of a great and titanic father.




Later life


Elliott pursued many different careers during his life, including owning a radio station in Texas, living as a rancher, and for a term in the 1960s as the mayor of 

Miami Beach, Florida
. As Elliott approached his 80th year of age, his final ambition was to  outlive James.   However, Elliott Roosevelt died at the age 80 of 
congestive heart failure.  His brother 
James Roosevelt survived Elliott by one year.




Author and biographer


He was also the author of numerous books, including a bestselling mystery series in which his mother, 
Eleanor Roosevelt, is the detective.


Elliott described his experiences with his father during the war years in his book As He Saw It.


Together with James Brough, Elliott wrote a highly personal book about his parents called The Roosevelts of Hyde Park: An Untold Story where he reveals details about the sexual lives of his parents, including his father's unique relationships with two mistresses 

Lucy Mercer
 and 

Marguerite ( Missy ) LeHand
 as well as graphic details surrounding the illness that crippled his father. The biography also contains valuable insights into Roosevelt's run for vice-president, rise to the governorship of New York, and his capture of the presidency in 1932, particularly with the help of 






Louis Howe





.




Marriages


Elliott Roosevelt was married five times:





 On 
January 16, 
1932 he married 
Elizabeth Browning Donner, daughter of 

William Henry Donner
. They had one son, 






William Donner Roosevelt





, in 1932. The marriage ended in divorce in 1933. She died in 1980.


 On 
July 22, 
1933, in 

Burlington, Iowa
, he married 
Ruth Josephine Googins. They had three children: 
Ruth Chandler Roosevelt (b. 1934), 
Elliott  Tony  Roosevelt Jr. (b. 1936), and 
David Boynton Roosevelt (b. 1942). Elliott and Ruth were divorced in March 1944. 
Ruth Googins Roosevelt Eidson died in 1974.


 On 
December 3, 
1944, at the 





Grand Canyon




 in 

Arizona
, he married actress 

Faye Emerson
. They were divorced on 
January 17, 
1950. She died of 
stomach cancer in 1983 in 



Spain


.


 On 
March 15, 
1951, at 

Miami Beach, Florida
, he married 
Minnewa Bell Gray Burnside Ross. They were divorced in 1960. Minnewa died in 1983.


 On 
November 3, 
1960, at 

Qualicum Beach, British Columbia
, 

Canada
, he married 
Patricia Peabody Whitehead. Her four children, 
James M. Whitehead, 
Ford Whitehead, 
Gretchen Whitehead and 
David Macauley Whitehead, all adopted 
Roosevelt as their surname. The couple's only child together, 
Livingston Delano Roosevelt, died in 1962 as an infant.

Baseball pitching




Long relievers are a type of 
relief pitcher in 
baseball. Long relievers traditionally enter early in a game (anywhere from the first inning to the fourth inning) when the starting pitcher cannot continue, whether due to ineffective pitching, lack of endurance, rain delays, injury, or ejection. The hope is that the long reliever will be able to get the game under control, and hopefully his team's offense will be able to help get the team back into the game. The hope is also that the long reliever will pitch long enough to save other relievers in the bullpen from having to pitch.  Long relievers are usually players that used to be 
starters either in the major leagues or in the minors (and still can be a temporary starter if one of the normal starters is injured or otherwise unavailable), but their teams feel they have better starters available.  Sometimes a team's long reliever is a former starter who has lost his effectiveness, either through a decline in skills or a series of injuries.  The quality of long relievers can vary but when the long reliever is known to be an ineffective former starter, they are often called the  mop up man  or  mop.

Extended Latin alphabet


Some languages have extended the Latin alphabet with 
ligatures, 
modified letters, or 
digraphs. These symbols are listed below. The characters in the following tables may not all render, depending on which 
operating system and 
browser version are used, and the presence or absence of 
Unicode 
fonts.


For the order in which the characters are sorted in each alphabet, see 
Collating sequence.

Notes






  In classical Latin, the digraphs 
CH, 
PH, 
RH, 
TH were used in loanwords from 

Greek
, but they were not included in the alphabet. The ligatures 
A, 
  and 
W, as well as lowercase letters, were added to the alphabet only in 
Middle Ages. The letters J and U were used as 
typographical variants of I and V, respectively, roughly until the 









Enlightenment








.



  Albanian officially has the digraphs dh, gj, ll, nj, rr, sh, th, xh, zh, which is sufficient to represent the 

Tosk
 dialect.  The 

Gheg
 dialect supplements the official alphabet with 6 nasal vowels, namely a, e, i, o, u,  .



  Arberesh apparently requires the digraphs dh, gj, hj, ll, nj, rr, sh, th, xh, zh.  Arberesh has the distinctive hj, which is considered as a letter in its own right.



  Basque has several digraphs: dd, ll, rr, ts, tt, tx, tz.  The u, which is pronounced as /o/, is required for various words in its Zuberoan dialect.



  Belarusian also has several digraphs: ch, dz, d , d .



  Breton also has the digraphs ch, c'h, zh.


 Catalan also has a large number of digraphs: dz, gu, (gu), ig, ix, ll, l l, nc, ny, qu, (qu), rr, ss, tz.



  Corsican has the trigraphs: chj, ghj.



 
  Croatian also has the digraphs: d , lj, nj. It can also be written with four tone markers above on top of the vowels. Note that Croatian Latin is the same as Serbian Latin and they both map 1:1 to 
Serbian Cyrillic, where the three digraphs map to Cyrillic letters  ,   and  , respectively. Rarely, digraph dj is used instead of   (Cyrillic  ).



  Czech also has the digraph: ch.


 The Norwegian alphabet is currently identical with the Danish alphabet. C is part of both alphabets and is used in native Danish, but not in native Norwegian. Norwegian and Danish uses e in  en  and more uses, although e is considered a diacritic mark, while a, a and o are letters. Q, w, z are not used except for names and some foreign words.


 The status of 
ij'' as a letter in Dutch is disputed.


 English generally now uses extended Latin letters only in loan words.  Rare publication guides may still use the dieresis on words, such as  cooperate , rather than the now-more-common  cooperate .  For a fuller discussion, see articles branching from 
Lists of English words of international origin, which was used to determine the diacritics needed for more unambiguous English.


 Filipino also uses the digraph ng, even originally with a large tilde that spanned both n and g (though its use is now rare). 


 In standard French, uppercase diacritics are never obligatory, but always in good style. Many pairs or triplets are read as digraphs or trigraphs depending on context, but are not treated as such lexicographically: consonants ph, (ng), th, gu/gu, qu, ce, ch/(sh/sch), rh; vocal vowels (ee), ai/ay, ei/ey, eu, au/eau, ou; nasal vowels ain/aim, in/im/ein, un/um/eun, an/am, en/em, om/on; the half-consonant -(i)ll-; half-consonant and vowel pairs oi, oin/ouin, ien, ion. When rules that govern the French orthography are not observed, they are read as separate letters, or using an approximating phonology of a foreign language for loan words, and there are many exceptions. In addition, most final consonants are mute (including those consonants that are part of feminine, plural, and conjugation endings). Accents on uppercase letters are generally obligatory in Canada.


 Galician. The standard of 1982 set also the digraphs gu, qu (both always before e and i), ch, ll, nh and rr. In addition, the standard of 2003 added the grapheme ao as an alternative writing of o. Although not marked (or forgotten) in the list of digraphs, they are used to represent the same sound, so the sequence ao should be considered as a digraph. Note also that nh represents a 
velar nasal (not a 
palatal as in 

Portuguese
) and is restricted only to three feminine words, being either 
demonstrative or 
pronoun: unha ('a' and 'one'), algunha ('some') and ningunha ('not one'). The Galician 
reintegracionismo movement uses it as in Portuguese.


 German also retains most original letters in French loan words. Swiss German does not use S any more. The long s ( ) was in use until the mid-20th century. Sch is usually not treated like a true trigraph, neither are ch and qu digraphs. Q only appears in the sequence qu, while y is found only (and x almost only) in loan words.



  Guarani also uses tilde over e, i, y, and g (the last one not available precomposed in Unicode), as well as digraphs ch, mb, nd, ng, nt, rr and the glottal stop  ' .



  Hausa has the digraphs: sh, ts.



  Hungarian also has the digraphs: cs, dz, gy, ly, ny, sz, ty, zs; and the trigraph: dzs.



  Irish formerly used the dot diacritic in  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  . These have been replaced by the digraphs: bh, ch, dh, fh, gh, mh, ph, sh, th except for in formal instances.



  Italian also has the digraphs: ch, gh, gn, gl, sc. J, K, W, X, Y are used in foreign words. X is also used for native words derived from Latin and Greek.



  Karakalpak also has the digraphs: ch, sh. C used only in digraphs. A', N', O', U' are considered as letters.   is lower case of I and   is upper case of i. F, H, V, X are used in foreign words. 



  Latvian also has the digraphs: dz, d , ie, as well as the triphthongal letter o. Dz and d  are occasionally considered separate letters of the alphabet in more archaic examples (which have been published as recently as the 1950s,) however modern alphabets and teachings discourage this due to an ongoing effort to set decisive rules for Latvian (and eliminate barbaric words accumulated during the Soviet occupation.) The digraph  ie  is never considered a separate letter. The Latvian o is also the only single-letter triphthong in any language in one letter it has the three vowel sounds u, o, and a, which combine into uoa.''



  Lithuanian also has the digraphs: ch, dz, d , ie, uo. However, these are not considered separate letters of the alphabet.



  Maltese also has the digraphs: ie, g .



  M ori uses g only in ng digraph. Wh is also a digraph.



  Some Mohawk speakers use orthographic i in place of the consonant y. The glottal stop is indicated with an apostrophe   and long vowels are written with a colon :.



  Piedmontese also uses the letter n- to indicate a velar nasal N-sound (pronounced as the gerundive termination in going), which usually precedes a vowel, as in lun-a [moon].



  Pinyin has four tone markers that can go on top of the any of the six vowels (a, e, i, o, u, u); e.g.: macron ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ), acute accent (a, e, i, o, u,  ), caron ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ), grave accent (a, e, i, o, u,  ). It also uses the digraphs: ch, sh, zh.



  Polish also has the digraphs: ch, cz, dz, d , d , sz, rz.



  Portuguese also uses the digraphs ch, lh, nh, ou, rr, ss. The 






trema





 on u is currently only used in 

Brazilian Portuguese
. Neither the digraphs nor accented letters are considered part of the alphabet.



  Romani has the digraphs:  h, d , kh, ph, th.


 Slovak also has the digraphs: dz, d , ch and unique letters 
 / , 
 / .


 Spanish uses several digraphs to represented single sounds: ch, gu (preceding e or i), ll, qu, rr; of these, the digraphs 
ch and 
ll were traditionally considered individual letters with their own name (che, elle) and place in the alphabet (after c and l, respectively), but in order to facilitate international compatibility the 
Royal Spanish Academy decided to cease this practice in 1994 and all digraphs are now collated as combinations of two separate characters. The c-cedilla c used earlier has been replaced completely by z.



  Swedish uses e in well integrated loan words like 
ide and 
arme, although e is considered a modified e, while a, a, o are letters. a and a are rarely used words. W and z are used in some integrated words like 
webb and 
zon. Q, u, e are used for names only, but exist in Swedish names. For foreign names o, e, n and more are sometimes used, but usually not. Swedish has many digraphs and some trigraphs. ch, dj, lj, rl, rn, rs, sj, sk, si, ti, sch, skj, stj and others are usually pronounced as one sound.



  Uzbek also has the digraphs: ch, ng, sh considered as letters. C used only in digraphs. G`, O` and apostrophe (') are considered as letters. Latters has typographical variants: G , O  and   respective.



  Vietnamese has five tone markers that can go on top (or below) any of the 12 vowels (a,  , a, e, e, i, o, o,  , u,  , y); e.g.: grave accent (a,  ,  , e,  , i, o,  ,  , u,  ,  ), hook above ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ), tilde (a,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , o,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ), acute accent (a,  ,  , e,  , i, o,  ,  , u,  , y), and dot below ( ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). It also uses the digraphs and trigraphs: ch, gi, kh, ng, ngh, nh, ph, th, tr, but they are no longer considered letters.



  Walloon has the digraphs and trigraphs: ae, ch, dj, ea, jh, oe, oen, oi, sch, sh, tch, xh; the letter x is only used in xh digraph, the letter j is almost only used in dj and jh digraphs



  Welsh has the digraphs ch, dd, ff, ng, ll, ph, rh, th. It also occasionally uses 
circumflexes, 
diaereses, 
acute accents and 
grave accents on its seven vowels (a, e, i, o, u, w, y), but accented characters are not regarded as separate letters of the alphabet.



  Xhosa has a large number of digraphs, trigraphs, and even one tetragraph are used to represent various phonemes: bh, ch, dl, dy, dz, gc, gq, gr, gx, hh, hl, kh, kr, lh, mb, mf, mh, n', nc, ndl, ndz, ngc, ngh, ngq, ngx, nh, nkc, nkq, nkx, nq, nx, ntl, ny, nyh, ph, qh, rh, sh, th, ths, thsh, ts, tsh, ty, tyh, wh, xh, yh, zh. It also occasionally uses 
acute accents, 
grave accents, 
circumflexes, and 
diaereses on its five vowels (a, e, i, o, u), but accented characters are not regarded as separate letters of the alphabet.

Island countries in the world



An island country is a 
country that is wholly confined to an 
island, several islands, an 
island group or several island groups, and has no territory on the 
mainland of a 
continent. Forty-seven of the 
world's countries are island countries (2008), including most of the smallest ones. 

Australia
 is not included as it is geographically considered a continent.


Island countries can be divided in two approximate groups. A group of large, relatively populous nations which are usually close to a 
continent including 
Japan, 









New Zealand








, 

Sri Lanka
, the 

Philippines
, 

Cuba
, the 











United Kingdom










, 

Madagascar
, and 

Indonesia
. These countries typically share cultural and political similarities with their continental neighbours, although there are differences. Island locations have frequently been advantageous, providing isolation from invasion and the maritime abilities of the population gave advantage in regional and international trade.


The other group comprises smaller island countries such as 

Malta
, 








Cyprus







, the 

Comoros
, the 
Bahamas, 

Tonga
, and the 

Maldives
. These countries tend to be very different from continental countries. Their small size usually means there is little agricultural land and rarely many 
natural resources. However, in modern times, smaller island countries around the world have become centres for 
tourism, which in many is the dominant industry.


Some island countries are centered on one or two major islands, such as the 











United Kingdom










, 









New Zealand








 or 
Japan. Others are spread out over hundreds or thousands of smaller islands, such as the 

Philippines
, 

Indonesia
 or the 

Maldives
. Some island countries share their islands with other countries; these include the United Kingdom and 

Ireland
, 

Haiti
 and 

Dominican Republic
, and 

Indonesia
, which shares islands with 

Papua New Guinea
, 

Brunei
, 

East Timor
 and 

Malaysia
.

Stephen Sprouse (
September 12, 
1953 - 
March 4, 
2004) was a 
fashion designer and 
artist credited with pioneering the 1980s mix of  uptown sophistication in clothing with a downtown punk and pop sensibility  
http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/05/nyregion/05SPRO.html?ex=1079473370 ei=1 en=74207fc16a1eef36.


Career



Stephen Sprouse's initial 
Day-Glo bright, sixties-inspired, 
graffiti-printed fashion collections for men and women wowed fashion editors, store buyers, and 
fashionistas alike, but he always had mixed business success. His initial collections (1983 - 1985) were huge critical hits, sold at only the best stores (his 1983 collections were sold exclusively at 

Bergdorf Goodman
 and 


Henri Bendel

 in New York City on a small scale). To much surprise in the fashion and retail communities, Sprouse declared bankruptcy in June 1985 (even though his base of influential fashion editors and high-end stores were firmly in place).  Sprouse cited production, late deliveries to stores, management and financial problems in an interview with 
Womens Wear Daily shortly after he closed his initial business.  


Sprouse informally showed a Fall 1985 collection to buyers and the press at his new showroom in Union Square on 





Broadway




 - the last location of 


Andy Warhol

's infamous  Factory  lofts.  A runway presentation at Club USA in 
NYC was initially planned (and largely promoted) for its grand opening.  Subsequently, the show was cancelled; a Stephen Sprouse Incorporated representative stated at the time that the show was canceled due to the company relocating to the new Union Square location. 


Sprouse referred to his Fall 1985 collection as being  more 
hippie weird  and seventies-inspired, with bell-bottom trousers, psychedelic prints, and maxi skirts, but lacked the funds and staff to produce the apparel.  


Sprouse was initially noted for using high-quality, expensive, custom-dyed/screen-printed fabrics (his woolens were sourced by the high-end Italian textile house Agnona) for his earliest collections.  Sprouse personally did the 
graffiti that adorned many of his very earliest garments (1983, early 1984).  


In September 1987, with financial backing from high-end furniture manufacturer 

Knoll International
 (then known as 
GFI/General Felt Industries), Sprouse opened a three-level store on Wooster Street in New York City; a second, much smaller store was opened in Los Angeles in the spring of 1988 at the Beverly Center shopping complex.  He partly abandoned his signature sixties silhouettes, instead drawing inspiration from the mid-seventies London-based 
Punk rock scene. For his Fall 1987 and Spring 1988 collections, he was given permission to use the (recently deceased) 


Andy Warhol

's  Camouflage  series of screen-prints to utilize as textile designs; for his Fall 1988  Signature  collection, he collaborated with artist 

Keith Haring
 to create several 
abstract prints of Jesus with 
graffiti.  His company, CSI ({Andrew} Cogan Sprouse Incorporated) also wholesaled the various collections ( Stephen Sprouse,   Sprouse,  and  S ) to retailers (commencing with his Spring 1988 collection), but he lost his financial backing due to production problems and poor sales, closing down again in December 1988, shortly after the company shipped their  Holiday  and  Resort  lines.   


In 1992, Sprouse designed an exclusive men's and women's  capsule collection  (i.e.: 32 pieces in whole) for 

Bergdorf Goodman
, dubbed  CyberPunk,  which featured 











Velcro










 in lieu of traditional buttons.  Sprouse (once again) largely sourced custom made textiles from Agnona for his fall 1992 collection.  The production of the collection was done entirely on a 
couture level, leading to extremely high-priced garments (e.g.: $500 for a pair of men's 
nylon underwear - that being one of the lowest priced items available).  

Bergdorf Goodman
 sold the line for two seasons (Fall 1992   Spring 1993), with very limited success, despite wide media coverage, and featuring Sprouse's garments in their window displays.


Sprouse showed a collection ( CyberGlitter ) at Club USA in NYC for Fall 1993, but it never went into full production, despite orders being placed. 


In 1995, 

Barneys New York
 handled the production of an exclusive women's spring/summer line.  

Vogue
 magazine featured the moderately priced garments in its pages, but it sold poorly.  That same year, Sprouse also served as the costume curator for the new 
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 
Cleveland, and designed the staff's uniforms.   


In 1998, with full production and backing from Italian manufacturer Staff International, he was briefly back in business, but the clothes sold poorly and were largely ignored by the fashion press and retailers that adored him in the 1980s.


Despite such ups and downs, Sprouse's apparel is still coveted - his clothing continues to fetch high prices in vintage stores and online (e.g.: eBay) for his most iconic pieces.


The graffiti logo bags he designed in collaboration with 


Marc Jacobs

 for 

Louis Vuitton
 in 2001 made the fashion world take notice once again.  The pieces sold-out instantly. 


In 2002, he created a vast collection of men's and women's apparel, home accessories, pool related items, etc. for the 

Target
 discount chain (dubbed  AmericaLand ) - all rendered in a 
graffiti 
 Stars   Stripes  motif.


For Fall 2006, 


Marc Jacobs

 utilized Sprouse's 1987 graffiti leopard images for handbags, shoes, and scarves for 

Louis Vuitton
, which sold-out instantly. 


Sprouse designed clothes for 

Blondie
's 




Debbie Harry



 (his one-time downstairs neighbor in the Bowery section of NYC) in the late 70s/early 80s, prior to becoming a commercial designer.  Sprouse worked extensively with the band 


Duran Duran

 in the late 80s, designing the clothes for their 1989 tour for the album 

Big Thing
, as well as the cover for their greatest hits album  of the same year.  Additionally, he styled and dressed 

Billy Idol
 in the early 90s for Idol's  comeback  (which garnered little interest). 


Sprouse launched himself as a commercial fashion designer when he competed in a fashion show contest of young designers in the spring of 1983 (at the suggestion of photographer and friend 






Steven Meisel





), sponsored by the 


Polaroid Corporation

 (he previously worked as a design assistant to 


Halston

 in the 1970s for three years).  Based upon the favorable editorial reaction he received, he soon after formed his first company, Stephen Sprouse, Inc., and set up a showroom and production space at 57th Street and 





Fifth Avenue




, launching his initial commercial collections for retail (prior to this, production of his early 1983 collections, done on a relatively small scale, was manufactured by Dianne Phelp's company  Triad ).  


Sprouse soon formed an in-house production staff for the small runway collection he showed in his silver-painted showroom (in homage to the 
Andy Warhol Factory loft of the sixties) in December 1983.  The show garnered much attention and very favorable reviews (notably from the 
New York Times Fashion Editor 
John Duka).  Sprouse's subsequent runway show, held at the NYC club 
The Ritz in May 2004 was the  must see  show of the season.


Financial backing was provided by his parents, Norbert and Joanne Sprouse, for Sprouse's initial business.


Sprouse died at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in 

New York City
 of 
heart failure, after a closely guarded diagnosis of 
lung cancer a year before. He was 50.

2004) was an 








American







 
blues 
guitarist and 
singer.


Career


He was born in 1942 in 

Osceola
, 

Arkansas
  where his father, Jim  Son  Seals, owned a small club. He began performing professionally by the age of 13, first as a 
drummer with Robert Nighthawk, and later as a guitarist. In 1959, he formed his own band which performed locally and he also toured with 





Albert King




.1 


In 1971, he moved to 

Chicago
. His career took off after he was discovered by 







Bruce Iglauer






 of 








Alligator Records







 at the Flamingo Club in 
Chicago's South Side.  His debut, 
The Son Seals Blues Band, was released in 1973. The 
album included  Your Love Is Like a Cancer  and  Hot Sauce .  Seals followed up with 1976's 
Midnight Son and 1978's Live and Burning. He continued releasing albums throughout the next two decades, all but one on 








Alligator Records







. These included 
Chicago Fire (1980), 
Bad Axe (1984), 
Living In The Danger Zone (1991), 
Nothing But The Truth and 
Live-Spontaneous Combustion (1996). He received the 



W.C. Handy Award


, an honor for best blues recording of the year, in 1985, 1987, and 2001. 


Author 
















Andrew Vachss















 was a friend of Seals, and used his influence to promote Seals' music.  Vachss gave Seals several 
cameo appearances in his 
novels2  and co-wrote songs with him for his 2000 album, Lettin' Go.3  Vachss dedicated the novel 

















Mask Market
















 to Seals' memory.4


In 2002, Seals was featured on the 


Bo Diddley

 tribute album Hey Bo Diddley - A Tribute!, performing the song  My Story  (aka  Story of Bo Diddley ).


Seals had a number of problems in his life. He survived all but one of his 14 
siblings; and he was shot in the jaw by his wife. Also, one of his legs was 
amputated, due to complications from 
diabetes.  He lost belongings in a fire that destroyed his home while he was away performing live, and several of his prize guitars were stolen from his home. 5


The band 




Phish



 performed Seal's song  
Funky Bitch  throughout their career, and brought him on stage on multiple occasions, turning a whole new generation on to his music.


Seals 
died in 2004 from complications of diabetes; he was survived by his sister and fourteen children.6

PC2700 200-pin DDR SO-DIMM



A SO-DIMM, or small outline dual in-line memory module, is a type of 
computer memory built using 
integrated circuits.

SO-DIMMs are a smaller alternative to a 
DIMM, being roughly half the size of regular DIMMs. SO-DIMMS are often used in systems which have space restrictions such as 
notebooks, small footprint PCs (such as those with a 
Mini-ITX 
motherboard), high-end upgradable office 
printers, and 
networking hardware like 
routers.


SO-DIMMs have 72, 100, 144, or 200 pins.  The 100 pin package supports 32-bit data transfer, while the 144 and 200 packages support 64-bit data transfer.  This compares to regular DIMMs that have 168, 184, or 240 pins, all supporting 64-bit data transfer.


Most types of SO-DIMMs can be recognized at a glance by the distinctive notches used to  key  them for different applications:  100-pin SO-DIMMs have two notches, 144-pin SO-DIMMs have a single notch near (but not at) the center, and 200-pin SO-DIMMs have a single notch nearer to one side.


The 200-pin SO-DIMM has two variations for locating the notch which are nearly indistinguishable to the naked eye.  If the notch is located further outboard, it indicates the DDR class of memory.  When the notch is located nearer the center of the board, it indicates DDR2.  These two types of memory are not interchangeable, and the different notch locations prevent incorrect installation.  The 200-pin SO-DIMM depicted in the accompanying photograph has the notch slightly outboard, and is thus DDR.  Caution should be exercised when visually identifying 200-pin SO-DIMM modules.


SO-DIMMs are more or less equal in power and voltage rating to DIMMs, and as memory technology moves forward, both SO-DIMMs and DIMMs become available in equal speed (clock speeds such as 400 MHz 


PC-3200

, for example, and 
CAS latency such as 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0) and capacity (512MB, 1GB, etc.).


At the time of writing (May 2008) DDR2 SO-DIMM memory modules commonly have clock speeds from 200 MHz up to 800 MHz 
PC2-6400 and 1066 MHz 
PC2-8500 are becoming available.


There are also new 204-pin SO-DIMM memory modules with PC3-6400/PC3-8500/PC3-10600/PC3-12800 specifications.

Defunct upper houses
Seanad Eireann
 Members of Seanad Eireann by session
Government in the Irish Free State




This article is about the historical Seanad Eireann of the Irish Free State.  For the modern Irish senate, see 
Seanad Eireann.  
Seanad Eireann (

English
: Senate of Ireland) was the 
upper house of the 





Oireachtas




 (parliament) of the 

Irish Free State
 from 1922 1936. It has also been known simply as the Senate, or as the First Seanad. The Senate was established under the 1922 






Constitution of the Irish Free State





 but a number of constitutional amendments were subsequently made to change the manner of its election and it powers. It was eventually abolished in 1936 when it attempted to obstuct constitutional reforms favoured by the government. It sat, like its modern successor, in 




Leinster House



.


Powers



The Free State Senate was subordinate to 
Dail Eireann (the lower house) and could only delay rather than veto decisions of that house. Nonetheless, the Free State Senate had greater power than its successor, the 
modern Seanad Eireann, which can only delay normal legislation for three months. As originally adopted the constitution provided that the Free State Senate had power to delay a 
money bill for 21 days and delay any other bill for 270 days (approximately nine months). In 1928 this second period was extended so that the Senate could delay an ordinary bill for twenty months.




Composition and election



The 1922 Constitution provided for a Senate of 60 members who would be directly elected. Members would serve 12 year terms, with one quarter of the house elected every three years. The members would be elected under the system of 
proportional representation by means of the 
Single Transferable Vote (STV) in a single, nationwide, fifteen seat constituency.


However, to get the house off the ground, the body's initial membership would be appointed by Dail Eireann (the lower house) and the president. To further complicate matters, after the holding of the first direct election the constitution was amended, so that the final three elections to the Senate occurred by a method of indirect election. Therefore, in the five elections to the Senate to occur before its abolition, three different systems were used.


It was originally required that membership of the Senate be limited to those who were over 35. Constitutional amendments made in 1928 reduced the minimum age to thirty and the term of office from twelve to nine years.


Today incarnations of the 
modern Seanad Eireann are given a new number after each senatorial election. Thus, the current Senate elected in 2002 is known as the  Twenty-second Seanad . This was not the custom during the Irish Free State because the Free State Senate was elected in stages and thus considered to be in permanent session. However, as a gesture of continuity with its Free State predecessor, the first Senate elected after 1937 is numbered as the  Second Seanad . The Free State Senate, despite the occurrence of three senatorial elections before its abolition, is considered to have been a single 'Seanad' for the duration of its existence and is thus referred for that whole period as the  First Seanad .



1922 election



One half the initial membership of the Senate was elected by the Dail under the system of 
STV. The remaining half were appointed by the 
President of the Executive Council (prime minister), 
WT Cosgrave. Those elected by the Dail were divided into two equal groups by lot, one assigned terms of three years and the other terms of nine. Those appointed by the president were similarly divided, and assigned terms of six and twelve years. The President agreed to use his appointments in 1922 to grant extra representation to the 


Protestant

 minority in the state. As a result, of the sixty members of the first Senate, as well as thirty six 
Roman Catholics, there were twenty 
Protestants, three 
 Quakers and one 


Jew

. Not only that, but it contained seven peers, a dowager countess, five baronets and several knights. The 
New York Times remarked that the first senate was  representative of all classes , though it has also been described as,  the most curious political grouping in the history of the Irish state . 1Members included 
WB Yeats, 
Oliver St John Gogarty and General Sir 













Bryan Mahon












. 


The opponents of the 



Anglo-Irish Treaty


 also opposed the new Senate, and thirty seven of the senators' homes were burnt to the ground. Others were intimidated, kidnapped and the subject of assassination attempts. Nevertheless, the first Senate greatly influenced the guiding principles and legislative foundations of the new state. 2




1925 election


The fifteen original three-year seats came up for election in 1925, as did four other seats which had been filled temporarily by co-option.  The 19 retiring members were automatically eligible for re-election; another 19 candidates were nominated by the Senate (by STV from a list of 29); the Dail nominated 38 candidates (from a list of 57, again by STV).  The 76 candidates were then put to the public electorate on 17 September 1925, but without partisan campaigning, turnout was less than a quarter of the 1,345,000 potential voters. The STV count took two weeks.  Only eight of the former senators were re-elected, with particularly poor results for the 
Gaelic League and 

Douglas Hyde
.3




Subsequent elections



After the amendment of the constitution in 1928, future members of the Senate were to be elected from a single constituency consisting of the combined membership of the outgoing senate and the Dail, and the system was changed so that a third rather than a quarter of the Senate would be replaced at each election. The elections were still held by secret ballot, and under STV. Elections took place under the new system in 1928, 1931, and 1934 before the Senate was abolished in 1936.


The system for nominating candidates was also changed. After 1928 it was provided that the number of nominees would be equal to twice the number of seats to be filled and that one-half would be elected by the Dail and one-half by the Senate. Both houses used STV for this purpose. The right of outgoing senators to nominate themselves was removed.




By-elections



The constitution originally provided that premature vacancies would be filled by a vote of the Senate. However a candidate elected in this way would only serve until the next senatorial election; then his or her seat would come up for election along with the others scheduled to be filled. In 1929 the system was changed so that vacancies were filled by members of both houses voting together.




Abolition


The Free State Senate was abolished entirely in 1936 after it delayed some Government proposals for constitutional changes.  
Eamon de Valera had seen its delay of his proposals as illegitimate; the continuing opposition majority had stemmed from a combination of his earlier boycott of the Free State Oireachtas and the provision for the Senate's self-election.  It opposed its own abolition, but this decision was overridden by the Dail. De Valera later created a 
new Senate in his 1937 constitution.





Direct democracy role



As adopted the Free State constitution contained a number of provisions for 
direct democracy, which included a special role for the Senate. Most importantly it was provided that the Senate could, if 60% of its number agreed, demand a binding 
referendum on any bill. This would have allowed the Senate to appeal to voters directly if there was a disagreement between the two houses and the Dail attempted to override the Senate. However this power was taken from the Senate in 1928 before it had been put into use. It was in compensation for this loss that the Senate's powers of delay were increased in the same year.


Before it was removed, the Senate's right to demand a referendum was contained in Article 47, which provided for voters to veto legislation directly in certain circumstances. The article provided that once a bill had been approved by both houses of the Oireachtas (or just by the Dail, if it had overridden the Senate) its enactment into law could be suspended if, within seven days, either a majority of the Senate or 40% of all members of the Dail so requested.


There would then be a further period of ninety days within which either 5% of all registered voters, or a 60% majority in the Senate, could demand a referendum on the bill. The referendum would be decided by a majority of votes cast and if rejected the bill would not become law. Article 47 did not apply to money bills or bills declared by both houses to be  necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety . In 1928 Article 47 was repealed in its entirety, along with Article 48 which provided for an 
initiative process.


A power not unlike that given to the Free State Seanad by Article 47 is granted to the modern Irish Senate by the 1937 


Constitution of Ireland

. Under the current constitution a simple majority of senators (with the agreement of one-third of the Dail) can request that the 


President of Ireland

 refer a bill to the people. This means that the President can refuse to sign it until it has been approved either in an 
ordinary referendum or by the Dail after it has reassembled after a general election. This power has never been used because the modern Senate is designed in such a way as to have a permanent government majority.




List of constitutional amendments



During the Irish Free State there were no less than twelve constitutional amendments relating to the Senate. These were





Constitution (Amendment No. 1) Act (11 July 1925): Made changes relating to the terms of office of senators, and the date on which senatorial elections were to be held.







Constitution (Amendment No. 10) Act (12 July 1928): This amendment removed a number of provisions for direct democracy from the constitution. These included the right of the Senate to force a referendum on certain bills.







Constitution (Amendment No. 6) Act (23 July 1928): Replaced the direct election of the Senate with the system of indirect election.







Constitution (Amendment No. 13) Act (23 July 1928): Extended the Senate's power of delay over legislation from nine months to twenty months.







Constitution (Amendment No. 8) Act (25 October 1928): Reduced the age of eligibility for senators from 35 to 30.







Constitution (Amendment No. 9) Act (25 October 1928): Removed the existing provisions for the nomination of Senate and candidates and empowered the Oireachtas to make alternative arrangements by law. The new system of nomination was then introduced by the Seanad Electoral Act, 1928 (which was enacted on the same day).







Constitution (Amendment No. 7) Act (30 October 1928): Reduced the term of office of senators from twelve to nine years.







Constitution (Amendment No. 14) Act (14 May 1929): Clarified a technical matter relating to the relationship between the two houses of the Oireachtas.







Constitution (Amendment No. 15) Act (14 May 1929): Permitted one member of the 
Executive Council (cabinet) to be a senator, where previously it had been required that all be members of the Dail. It was still required that the President, Vice-President and Minister for Finance hold seats in the Dail.







Constitution (Amendment No. 11) Act (17 December 1929): Altered the method for the filling of premature vacancies in the Senate.







Constitution (Amendment No. 12) Act (24 March 1930): Altered provisions relating to the Committee of Privileges that had authority to resolves disputes between the two Houses of the Oireachtas over the definition of a money bill.







Constitution (Amendment No. 24) Act (29 May 1936): Abolished the Senate entirely after it had delayed some Government proposals for constitutional changes.




It was replaced by the modern Senate, 
Seanad Eireann, established by the 


Constitution of Ireland

 in 1937. This new Seanad was considered to be the direct successor of the Free State Seanad.

Sleep
Spanish loanwords





This article is about the short nap.  For other uses, see 
Siesta (disambiguation).



A painting of a young woman taking a siesta. (The hammock, Gustave Courbet (1844).)


 


A siesta (Spanish pronunciation: ) is a short nap taken in the early afternoon, often after the midday 
meal. Such a period of 
sleep is a common tradition in some countries, particularly those where the weather is warm. The word siesta is 

Spanish
, from the 

Latin
 hora sexta -  the sixth hour  (counting from dawn, therefore noon, hence  midday rest ).



Origins of the siesta



The siesta is the traditional daytime sleep of Spain, and through Spanish influence, of many 










Latin America









n countries. 

Brazil
, colonized not by Spain but by 

Portugal
, stands in cultural contrast.


Factors explaining the geographical distribution are mainly high temperatures and heavy to very heavy intake of food at the midday meal. These two factors combined contribute to the feeling of post-lunch drowsiness.  Afternoon sleep is also a common habit in the 

Philippines
, 
China, 

Vietnam
, 

India
, 



Italy


, 

Greece
, 

Croatia
, 

Malta
, 
the Middle East and 
North Africa.   In these countries, the heat can be unbearable in the early afternoon, making a midday break at home ideal.  However, in some countries where naps are taken, such as Northern Spain, Southern Argentina, and Chile, the climate is similar to that of Canada and Northern Europe. In many areas with this habit, it is common to have the largest meal of the day in the very early afternoon, as is practical and common in farming. 


The original concept of a siesta seems to have been merely that of a midday break intended to allow people to spend time with their friends and family. It has been suggested that the long length of the modern siesta dates back to the 

Spanish Civil War
, when 
poverty resulted in many Spaniards working multiple jobs at irregular hours, pushing back meals to later in the afternoon and evening.
1 However, this hypothesis sounds unlikely, considering that the siesta tradition was very common in Latin America and other countries with Hispanic influence, much before the Spanish Civil War.




Biological need for naps



Older, pre-teenage children are usually incapable of napping, but acquire the ability to nap as teenagers.1


The timing of sleep in humans depends upon a balance between 
homeostatic sleep propensity, the need for sleep as a function of the amount of time elapsed since the last adequate sleep episode, and 
circadian rhythms which determine the ideal timing of a correctly structured and restorative sleep episode. The homeostatic pressure to sleep starts growing upon awakening. The circadian signal for wakefulness starts building in the (late) afternoon. As Harvard professor of 
sleep medicine 
Charles A. Czeisler puts it:  


 The circadian system is set up in a beautiful way to override the homeostatic drive for sleep. 2


Thus, in many people, there is a dip when the drive for sleep has been building for hours and the drive for wakefulness has not yet started. This is, again quoting Czeisler,  a great time for a nap.  The drive for wakefulness intensifies through the evening, making it difficult to get to sleep 2-3 hours before one's usual bedtime when the wake maintenance zone ends.


In some individuals, 
postprandial dip, a brief drop in 
blood glucose levels caused by the body's normal insulin response to a heavy meal, may produce drowsiness after the meal that can encourage a nap. However, the appearance of the dip is primarily circadian as it occurs also in the absence of the meal.




Siesta in other cultures




 
The concept of a midday nap is also prominent in other tropical or subtropical countries, where the afternoon heat dramatically reduces work productivity. The 
Washington Post of February 13, 2007 reports at length on studies in Greece that indicate that those who nap have less risk of heart attack. 
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/12/AR2007021200626.html


In 


South Asia

, the idea of a post-lunch nap is common, and the idea of going to sleep after a light massage with 
mustard oil to induce drowsiness was very popular before industrialization. It was also very popular to consume a light snack during this ritual; it was thought that this practice would make one a better person. In 

Bangladesh
 and 






Indian Bengal





, the word which describes the concept is bhat-ghum, literally meaning  rice-sleep  (nap after consuming rice).


Afternoon sleep is also a common habit in China and 

Taiwan
 after the midday meal. This is called xiuxi or wushui in Chinese.  Almost all schools in Mainland China and Taiwan have a half-hour nap period right after lunch.  This is a time when all lights are out and one is not allowed to do anything other than rest or sleep.


Some 
Japanese offices have special rooms known as napping rooms for their workers to take a nap during lunch break or after overtime work.


In Islam, it is encouraged to take a short nap around 15-30 minutes before the time for 
Dhuhr prayers, with the intention of doing 
tahajjud later in the night.

A hallmark, is an official mark or series of marks struck on items made of precious metals   
platinum, 
gold, 
silver and in some nations, 
palladium.  In a more general sense, the term  can also be used refer to any distinguishing characteristic or trait. 


Historically, hallmarks were applied by a trusted party: the 'guardians of the 
craft' or nowadays by an 
assay office. Hallmarks are a guarantee of certain purity or fineness of the metal as determined by formal metal (assay) testing. 




Hallmarks Distinguished from Other Marks



Hallmarks are often confused with  trademarks  or  maker's mark .  Hallmarks are an official mark of guaranteed metal content, trademarks are the mark of the party responsible for making the item.


Simple number marks such as 750 or 925 (albeit intended to denote the fineness of the metal) also are not to be confused as being a hallmark unless accompanied with an official country hallmark as described by the country's hallmarking methodology.  Simple number marks are often struck into the metal by the manufacturer, and unfortunately may not always reflect the true purity of the compound metal.




Pre-requisites to Hallmarking



Notwithstanding the hallmarking systems of many nations require, as a prerequisite to official hallmarking, that the maker or sponsor itself mark upon the item a responsibility mark and a claim of fineness.  Responsibility marks are also required in the U.S. if metal fineness is claimed despite the fact that there is no official hallmarking scheme in that country.  Nevertheless, in nations with an official hallmarking scheme, the hallmark is only applied after the item has been 
assayed to determine that its purity conforms not only to the standards set down by the law but also and with the maker s claims as to metallurgical content.




Systems Differ from Nation to Nation


In some nations, such as the UK, the hallmark is made up of several elements including: a mark denoting the type of metal, the maker/sponsor's mark and the year of the marking.  In other nations, such as Poland, the hallmark is a single mark indicating metal and fineness, augmented by a responsibility mark (known as a sponsor's mark in the UK).  Among a group of nations which are signatories to an international convention known as the 
Vienna Convention, additional, optional, yet official marks may also be struck by the assay office. These have the effect of easing import obligations among and between the member states.  Signatory countries have a single representative hallmark which would be struck next to the Convention mark which represents the metal and fineness.





History of Hallmarking



Ancient Byzantine Hallmarks

 
The control or inspection of precious metals was an ancient concept of examination and marking, by means of inspection stamps (punch marks). The use of hallmarks, at first, on silver has a long history dating back to the fourth century AD and represents the oldest known form of consumer protection. A series or system of five marks has been found on 
Byzantine silver dating from this period though their interpretation is still not completely resolved.1




Hallmarking in the Late Middle Ages


However, from the Late 
Middle Ages, hallmarking was administered by local governments through authorized assayers. These assayers examined precious metal goods, under the auspices of the state, before the good could be offered for public sale.  By the age of the Craft Guilds, the authorized examiner s mark was the  master s mark  which consisted frequently of his initials and/or the coat of arms of the goldsmith or silversmith. At one time, there was no distinction among silversmiths and goldsmiths who were all referred to as  orfevres , the French word for goldsmith.  The Master Craftsman was responsible for the quality of the work that left his 
atelier'' or workshop, regardless of who made the item.  Hence the responsibility mark is still known today in French as le poincon de maitre literally  the maker's punch . In this period, fineness was more or less standardized in the major European nations (writ: France and England) at 20 











karat










s for gold and 12 to 13 lots (75% to 81%) for silver, but the standards could only be partly enforced owing to the general nature of the time.[]



France


Hallmarking is Europe's earliest form of 
consumer protection. Hallmarking in Europe appears  first in France, with the 
Goldsmiths Statute of 1260promulgated under 
Etienne Boileau, 
Provost of Paris, for 



King Louis IX


  St. Louis . A standard for silver was thus, established. In 1275, 
Philippe III  the Bold  prescribed by royal decree, the mark for use on silver works, along with specific punches for each community's smiths. In 1313, his successor, 
Philippe IV  the Fair  expanded the use of hallmarks to gold works.




England


In 1300, 


King Edward I of England

 enacted a statute ordering that all silver articles must meet the 
Sterling silver standard (92.5% pure silver), and should be assayed by 'guardians of the craft', who would then mark the item with a leopard's head.  In 1327, 


King Edward III of England

 granted a charter to the 


Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths

 (more commonly known as the Goldsmiths' Company), marking the beginning of the Company's formal existence. This entity was headquartered at London's  Goldsmiths' Hall of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmith  from whence the English term  hallmark  is derived.




Switzerland


In 1424, the French Archbishop Jean de Brogny, after having consulted with a council of eight Masters Goldsmiths from 

Geneva
, enacted a regulation on the purity and hallmarking of silver objects following the French standards for application in Geneva. Although gold was certainly used for articles, the regulation was silent on gold standards and its hallmarking.2 (Today in Switzerland3, only precious metal watch cases must be hallmarked.4  Perhaps this attests to the significance of watches to the Swiss economy.  The hallmarking of other items including silverware and jewelry is optional.)




Augmentations in France and England





In 1355, individual maker marks were introduced in France, which concept was later mirrored in England in 1363, adding accountability to the two systems.







In 1427, the date letter system was established in France, allowing the accurate dating of any hallmarked piece.







In 1478, the 
Assay Office was established in 
Goldsmiths' Hall.  At this time, the date letter system was introduced in England.







In 1697, a higher standard of silver, known as the 




Britannia standard



 (95.8% silver) was made compulsory in England to protect the new coinage which was being melted down by silversmiths for the silver.  The Sterling standard was restored in 1720.








Modern hallmarks






Common Control Marks for gold, silver, and platinum.






Hallmark for the gold



In the modern world, in an attempt at standardizing the legislation on the inspection of precious metals and to facilitate international trade, in 1973 a core group of European nations signed the Vienna Convention on the control of the fineness and the hallmarking of precious metal objects.5 Those articles, which are assayed and found to be in conformity by the qualifying office of a signatory country, receive a mark, known as the 
Common Control Mark (CCM), attesting to the material's fineness.  The multi-tiered motif of the CCM is the balance scales, superimposed, for gold, on two intersecting circles; for platinum, a diamond shape and for silver a mark in the shape of the Latin letter  M . 


This mark is recognized in all the other contracting States, including: Austria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Great Britain, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland and Ukraine (see links below). Other nations monitor the activities of the Convention and may apply for membership.


Complete international hallmarking has been plagued by difficulties, because even amongst countries which have implemented hallmarking, standards and enforcement vary considerably, making it difficult for one country to accept another's hallmarking as equivalent to its own.  Many nations monitor the Vienna system and procedures are in place to allow additional nations to join the Vienna Convention. Similarly, with the consent all the current member states, the terms of the Convention may be amended.


The most significant item currently up for debate is the recognition of palladium as a precious metal.  Some member nations recognize palladium as a precious metal while others do not. (See list of nations below).

The 





Hallmarking Act 1973




 made Britain a member of the Vienna Convention as well as introducing marking for platinum, a recognized metal under the Convention.  All four remaining assay offices finally adopted the same date letter sequences. The latest changes in 1999 were made to the UK hallmarking system to bring the system closer into line with the 

European Union
 (EU).


As it now stands, the compulsory part of the UK hallmark consists of the sponsor or maker's mark, the assay office mark, and the standard of fineness (in this case silver, 925 parts in 1000). 


Examples of British hallmarks for 925 silver.



These are shown in the top of the two example hallmarks.  The bottom example shows the extra marks that can also be struck, the lion passant, indicating Sterling silver, the date mark (lowercase a for '2000'), and in this example, the 'Millennium mark', which was only available for the years 1999 and 2000.  The bottom example bears the Yorkshire rose mark for the Sheffield Assay Office.6




In Switzerland






The Swiss hallmark used since 1995 for all metals and all fineness



Although hallmarking in the Swiss territories dates back to Geneva in the 1400's there was no uniform system of hallmarking in Switzerland until 1881.  Before that time, hallmarking was undertaken at the local level by the Swiss cantons.  With the introduction of the  Swiss system of hallmarking in 1881, there was uniformity throughout the nation. Under the current law, on all gold, silver, platinum or palladium watches cases made in Switzerland or imported into Switzerland, 
(Fr.) there shall be affixed, near the Maker's Responsibility Mark and his indication of purity, the official Hallmark, the head of a Saint-Bernard dog (illustrated below). Only precious metal watch cases must be hallmarked. Swiss hallmarking for other articles such as jewelry and cutlery is optional. In addition to the Swiss hallmark, all precious metal goods may be stamped with the Common Control Mark of the Vienna Convention.




In the Netherlands


The Dutch, who are members of the International hallmarking Convention, have been striking hallmarks since at least 1814.  Like many other nations, the Dutch require the registration and use of Responsibility Marks, however, perhaps somewhat unique, the Dutch publish a book entitled  Netherlands' Responsibility Marks since 1797  (in three volumes and in the English language) illustrating all the responsibility marks registered there since that time. This is significant since producers that exported precious metal good to the Netherlands would have been required to register their marks.


The Dutch government markets their assay services/office as the  Jewellery Gateway in and to Europe.  The Netherlands' hallmarks are also recognized in other E.U. countries and thus can be sold in Austria, France, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom without further testing. The Netherlands' hallmarks are also recognized in Belgium, Denmark, Finland and Sweden, which have voluntary hallmarking systems. 


The Dutch assay office is located in Gouda between the Amsterdam and Rotterdam Airports. The Dutch recognize platinum, gold, silver and palladium as precious metals.





Marking techniques



Punching


Traditionally, the hallmarks are 'struck' using steel punches.  Punches are made in different sizes, suitable for tiny pieces of jewelry to large silver platters.  Punches are made in straight shank or ring shank, the former for normal punching with a hammer, and the later used with a press to mark rings. The problem with traditional punching is that the process of punching displaces metal, causing some distortion of the article being marked.  This means that re-finishing of the article is required after hallmarking.  For this reason, and that off-cuts from  
sprues are often used for assay, many articles are sent unfinished to the assay office for assay and hallmarking.




Laser marking


A new method of marking using 
lasers is now available, which is especially valuable for delicate items and 
hollowware, which would be damaged or distorted by the punching process.  Laser marking also means that finished articles do not need to be re-finished.  Laser marking works by using high power lasers to evaporate material from the metal surface.  Two methods exist, 2D and 3D laser marking.  2D laser marking burns the outline of the hallmarks into the object, while 3D laser marking better simulates the marks made by punching.





Methods of assay


Precious metal items of art or jewelry are frequently hallmarked (depending upon the requirements of the laws of either the place of manufacture or the place of import). Where required to be hallmarked, semi-finished precious metal items of art or jewelry pass through the official testing channels where they are analyzed or 
assayed for precious metal content.  While different nations permit a variety of legally acceptable finenesses, the assayer is actually testing to determine that the fineness of the product conforms with the statement or claim of fineness that the maker has claimed (usually by stamping a number such as 750 for 18k gold) on the item.  In the past the assay was conducted by using the touchstone method but currently (most often) it is done using X-ray Fluorescence (XRF). XRF is used  because this method is more exacting than the touchstone test. The most exact method of assay is known as fire assay or cupellation.  This method is better suited for the assay of bullion and gold stocks rather than works or art or jewelry because it is a completely destructive method.



The touchstone


The age-old touchstone method is particularly suited to the testing of very valuable pieces, for which sampling by destructive means, such as scraping, cutting or drilling is unacceptable. A rubbing of the item is made on a special stone, treated with acids and the resulting color compared to references. Differences in precious metal content as small as 10 to 20 parts per thousand can often be established with confidence by the test. It is not indicated for use with white gold, for example, since the color variation among white gold alloys is almost imperceptible.




 X-ray fluorescence


The modern X-ray fluorescence is also a non-destructive technique that is suitable for normal assaying requirements. It typically has an accuracy of 2-5 parts per thousand and is well-suited to the relatively flat and large surfaces. It is a quick technique taking about three minutes, and the results can be automatically printed out by the computer. It also measures the content of the other alloying metals present. It is not indicated, however, for articles with chemical surface treatment or electroplating. 




The fire assay (cupellation)


The most elaborate, but totally destructive, assay method is the 
fire assay. As applied to gold bearing metallics, as in hallmark assaying, it is also known as cupellation and can have an accuracy of 1 part in 10,000. In this process the article is melted, the alloys separated and constituents weighed. Since this method is totally destructive, when this method is employed for the assay of jewelry, it is done under the guise of random or selective sampling. For example if a single manufacturer deposits a lot of rings or watch cases, while most are assayed using the non-destructive methods a few pieces from the lot are randomly selected for fire assay.




Other methods


There are methods of assay noted above which are more properly suited for finished goods while other methods are suitable for use on raw materials before artistic workmanship has begun. Raw precious metals (bullion or metal stock) are assayed by the following methods: silver is assayed by 
titration, gold is assayed by 
cupellation and platinum is assayed by ICP OES 
spectrometry.

Themisto (pronounced  th -MIS-toe, or as in Greek        ), also known as Jupiter XVIII, is a small 
prograde 
irregular satellite of 
Jupiter. It was discovered in 1975, lost, and then rediscovered in 2000.


Discovery and naming



Themisto was first discovered by 








Charles T. Kowal







 and 








Elizabeth Roemer







 on 
September 30, 
1975, reported on 
October 3, 
19751and designated S/1975 J 1. However, not enough observations were made to establish an orbit and it was subsequently lost.


Themisto appeared as a footnote in astronomy textbooks into the 1980s. Then, in 2000, a seemingly new satellite was discovered by 






Scott S. Sheppard





, 








David C. Jewitt







, 
Yanga R. Fernandez and 
Eugene A. Magnier, and was designated S/2000 J 1. It was soon confirmed that this was the same as the 1975 object. The Sheppard et al. announcement2 was immediately correlated with an 
August 6 
2000 observation by the team of 






Brett J. Gladman





, 






John J. Kavelaars





, 
Jean-Marc Petit, 






Hans Scholl





, 






Matthew J. Holman





, 








Brian G. Marsden







, 
Philip D. Nicholson and 
Joseph A. Burns   an observation that was reported to the Minor Planet Center but not published as an IAU Circular (IAUC).3


In October 2002 it was officially named after 
Themisto4, daughter of the river god 






Inachus





 by 

Zeus
 (Jupiter) in 
Greek mythology.




Characteristics





Diagram illustrating Themisto's orbit (top left) among those of the other irregular satellites of Jupiter. The satellites above the horizontal axis are 
prograde, the satellites beneath it are retrograde. The yellow segments extend from the 
pericentre to the 
apocentre, showing the 
orbital eccentricity. 



Themisto's orbit is unusual. Unlike most of Jupiter's moons, which orbit in distinct groups, Themisto orbits alone, midway between the 

Galilean moons
 and the 





first group of prograde irregulars




. 


Themisto is about 8 kilometers in diameter (assuming an 
albedo of 0.04)

 History 



In 






Lewis





' Topographical Dictionary of Ireland, published in 1837, Ovens is described under the townland name of Athnowen:


ATHNOWEN (ST. MARY), or OVENS, a parish partly in the barony of BARRETTS, but chiefly in that of EAST MUSKERRY, county of CORK, and province of MUNSTER, 1  mile (W.) from Ballincollig; containing 1953 inhabitants.


This parish, which is generally called Ovens, is situated on the south line of road from Cork to Macroom, and is bounded on the north by the river Lee, and intersected by the Bride.


It comprises 4660 statute acres, as applotted under the tithe act, and valued at  7594 per annum: the soil in the northern or hilly part is rather poor and stony, but in the vales extremely rich, lying on a sub-stratum of limestone forming part of the great limestone district extending to Castlemore on the west, and to Blackrock on the east. The limestone is quarried to some extent for burning into lime for the supply of the hilly districts to the north and south for a distance of several miles.


The principal seats are Grange, the residents of J. Hawkes Esq., which occupies the site of Grange abbey (said to have been founded by St. Cera, who died in 679), and includes part of the ancient walls; Sirmount of G. Hawkes, Esq., which occupies an elevated site commanding and extensive propspect over a highly interesting and richly cultivated tract of the country; Spring Mount, of S. McCarthy Esq.; Clashenure, of Kyrle Allen, Esq.; and the glebe-house of the Rev. W. Harvey.


There are two boulting-mills on the river Bride; one at Killumney belonging to Mr. D. Donovan, jun.; and the other at Ovens, belonging to Messrs. R. Donovan and Sons.


The petty session for the District are held every alternative week at Carroghally. The living is a rectory and vicarage, in the diocese of Cork, united by diocesan authory, in 1785, to the prebend of Kilnaglory in the cathedral church of St. Finbarr, Cork: the tithes amount to  425.


The church is a neat ancient structure with a square tower crowned with pinncales. There is a glebe-house, with a glebe of 20a. 2r. 17p. In the Roman Catholic divisions this parish is the head of a union or district called Ovens, which included also the parishes of Desertmore and Aglish, and the ploughlands of Millane and Killumney, in the parish of St. Finbarr, Cork: the chapel, erected in 1835 is a handsome edifice of hewn limestone, in the mixed Gothic and Grecian styles of architecture.


The male and female parochial schools are supported principally at the expense of the rector. There is also a national school, in which are 140 children, under the patronage of the Roman Catholic clergy, for which a spacious school-room has been built near the chapel. A dispensary has been established for the relief of the sick poor.


Near the bridge of Ovens over the river Bride is the entrance of the celebrated limestone caves, which Smith, in his history of Cork, describes as 18 feet in height; but from the accumulation of rubbish they are now not more than three feet high and are nearly filled with water. They branch off into several ramifications, and from the roofs of some of them depend stalactites of various forms: their dimensions have never been satisfactorily ascertained.


There some remains of the ancient castle called Castle Inchy.




 Today 


Today, Ovens remains a largely rural parish, though urban encroachment from west Ballincollig and the extension of the South Ring Road (N25) has caused large changes especially to the eastern part of the parish.


Eire Og is the local parish hurling and gaelic football club. 


There are two primary schools: 
Ovens National School and 
Farran National School. Ovens parish website is- http://www.ovensparish.com


Agriculture remains the dominant local industry, though companies such as 

EMC Corporation
 and John A. Wood Ltd. provide much employment to both locals and those in the greater Cork area.

The Scottish Labour Party, also known as the Scottish Parliamentary Labour Party, was formed by 
Robert Cunninghame-Graham, the first 
socialist 
MP in the 
parliament of the United Kingdom, who later went on to become the first president of the 

Scottish National Party
, and 











Keir Hardie










, who later became the first leader of the 

Labour Party (UK)
. 


Robert Cunninghame-Graham, a strong supporter of 
Scottish independence, was the party's only MP, for the 




North West Lanarkshire



 constituency, between his defection from the 

Liberal Party
 in 1888 and his defeat in the 







United Kingdom general election






 
1892, in the 




Glasgow Camlachie



 constituency.


Keir Hardie had also left the Liberal Party in order to help found the Scottish Labour Party, and like many of the party's members, had previously been involved in the 

Scottish Land Restoration League
.


In 
1893 the party dissolved itself into the 

Independent Labour Party
.

South Africa
 in 1943.





Askari is an 

Arabic
, 

Turkish
, 
Somali, 

Persian
, and 
Swahili word meaning  soldier  (

Arabic
:       lrm;  askar ). It was normally used to describe indigenous troops in 
East Africa and the 



Middle East


 serving in the armies of 
European colonial powers. The designation can however also describe police, gendarmerie and security guards.1


During the period of European rule in East Africa locally recruited askari soldiers were employed by the Italian, British, Portuguese, German and Belgian colonial forces. They played a crucial role in the initial conquest of the various colonial possessions and subsequently served as garrison and internal security forces. During both World Wars askari units served outside the boundaries of their colonies of origin.



British Empire


The British Imperial British East African Company raised units of askari from amongst the Swahili, Sudanese and Somali peoples. There was no official uniform, nor standardised weaponry. Many of the askaris campaigned in their native dress. Officers wore civilian clothes. From 1895 the British askaris were organised into a regular, uniformed force called the East African Rifles, later part of the 



King's African Rifles


.2




German Empire


The German Colonial Army (
Schutztruppe) of the 

German Empire
 employed native African troops with European officers and 
NCOs in its colonies. The main concentration of such locally recruited troops was in 

German East Africa
 (now 

Tanzania
.) Formed in 1881 after the transfer of the Wissmanntruppe (raised in 1889 to suppress the Abushiri) to German imperial control. Although the first Askaris formed in East Africa were by DAOG (Deutsche Ost-Afrika Gesellschaft - the German East Africa Company) in about 1888. Originally drawn from Sudanese mercenaries, the German askaris were subsequently recruited from the 
Wahehe and Angoni tribal groups. They were harshly disciplined (as all German troops of that time) but well paid (on a scale twice that of their British counterparts in the 



King's African Rifles


) and highly trained by German cadres who were themselves subject to a rigorous selection process. Prior to 1914 the basic Schutztruppe unit in East Africa was the feldkompagnie comprising seven or eight German officers and NCOs with between 150 and 200 askaris (usually 160) - including two machine gun teams. Such small independent commands were often supplemented by tribal irregulars or ruga-ruga.   


They were successfully used in German East Africa where 11,000 askaris, porters and their European officers commanded by 

Paul Emil von Lettow-Vorbeck
 managed to resist numerically superior British, Portuguese and Belgian colonial forces until the end of 

World War I
 in 1918.


The 

Weimar Republic
 provided pension payments to the German Askaris.  Due to interruptions during the worldwide depression and World War II, the parliament of the 
Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) voted in 1964 to fund the back pay of the askaris still alive.  The West German embassy at Dar es Salaam identified approximately 350 ex-askaris and set up a temporary cashiers office at Mwanza on Lake Victoria.  Only a few claimants could produce the certificates given to them in 1918; others provided pieces of their old uniforms as proof of service.  The German banker who had brought the money came up with an idea: as each claimant stepped forward he was handed a broom and ordered in German to perform the manual of arms.  Not one of them failed the test.3

Nazi Germany


During WWII, Germans used the term Askari for Soviet deserters or prisoners who switched sides and collaborated with them.

Italian Empire


The Italian army also employed native troops in 

Italian East Africa
. These forces comprised infantry, cavalry and some light artillery units. They were recruited initially from 

Eritrea
ns and subsequently 

Somali
s, with Italian officers and some NCOs. The Italian askaris fought in the 
First Italo Ethiopian War, 
Italian-Turkish War, 

Second Italo-Abyssinian War
 and World War II (












East African Campaign











). Out of a total of 256,000 Italian troops serving in Italian East Africa in 1940, about 182,000 were recruited from Eritrea, Somalia and the recently occupied (1935-36) Ethiopia. In January 1941, British Commonwealth forces invaded Ethiopia and the majority of the newly recruited Ethiopian askaris serving with the Italian Army in East Africa deserted. Most of the Eritrean askaris remained loyal until the Italian surrender four months later.




Spanish Colonies


As noted above  askari  was normally a designation used in East Africa. Exceptionally though, the term  askari  was also used by the Spanish colonial government in North-West Africa, in respect not of their regular Moroccan troops (see 
regulares), but a locally recruited gendarmerie force raised in Spanish Morocco in 1913 and known as the  Mehal-la Jalifianas . This was the equivalent of the better known 

Goumier
s employed in French Morocco. Indigenous members of the 
Tropas Nomadas or desert police serving in the Spanish 











Sahara










 were also designated as  askaris .




Iraq War


Ugandan private security guards for American installations in Iraq are also designated as askari.  Guards were to receive $1,000 monthly salary and an $80,000 bonus if shot, but many have complained that the money was not paid or unfair fees assessed.  The guards work for recruiting agencies such as 
Askar Security Services, which are hired by 
Beowulf International, a receiving company in Iraq, which subcontracts their services to 
EOD Technologies, an American company hired by the 
U.S. Department of Defense to provide security guards for 

Camp Victory
 in 

Baghdad
.  A Beowulf representative said that 400 of the workers  had impressed the US Army with their skill and experience , but complained that some of the workers lacked police or security experience and  didn't even know how to hold a gun .  At least eleven other Ugandan recruiters include 
Dresak International and 
Connect Financial Services.4




Other uses





In 
apartheid 

South Africa
, Askari was the term given to guerrillas who were captured by the South African army and 'turned' or converted into spies or soldiers for the apartheid regime.







Askari can also mean  spear bearer .







Older bull 
elephants which break away from the herd often form the nucleus of  bachelor herds  with one or a number of younger males.  These younger males are referred to as 'askari' (both for singular elephants and groups of elephants).







 Askari are a minor class of creature in the African/tropical-themed  and  (and later 
Time Spiral) expansion sets of the 
collectable card game 5.

Power Girl (real name Kara Zor-L, also known as Karen Starr) is a 

DC Comics
 
superheroine, making her first appearance in 
All Star Comics #58 (January/February 1976).


Power Girl is the 
Earth-Two counterpart of 

Supergirl
 and the first cousin of the Earth-Two 


Superman

. The infant Power Girl's parents enabled her to escape the destruction of 

Krypton
.  Although she left the planet at the same time that Superman did, her ship took much longer to reach Earth-Two. 


Possessing superhuman strength and the ability to fly, she is a member of the 

Justice Society of America
 and the team's first chairwoman. Power Girl sports a 
bob of blond hair, wears a distinctive white, red, and blue costume, and has an aggressive fighting style. Throughout her early appearances in All Star Comics, Power Girl was frequently at odds with 
Wildcat, who had a penchant for talking to her as an if she was an ordinary Earthling female (instead of a superpowered Kryptonian), which she found annoying.


The 1985 
limited series 

Crisis on Infinite Earths
 eliminated Earth-Two and rewrote Power Girl s origin; she became a granddaughter of the 

Atlantean
 
sorcerer 











Arion










. However, story events culminating in the 2005-2006 crossover 















Infinite Crisis














 restored her status as a refugee from the Krypton of the Earth-Two universe.



Fictional character biography



Journey from Krypton-Two


Kara's father Zor-L discovers that Krypton is about to explode, and places her in a spacecraft directed towards the Earth. Although this occurs at the same time that Kal-L's ship is launched, Kara's ship travels more slowly, and she arrives on Earth decades after her cousin has landed. Kara s Symbioship is designed to keep her in stasis during the journey and provide her with life experiences and education in the form of 
virtual reality. The Symbioship allows her to interact with virtual copies of her parents and fellow Kryptonians within her home city of 








Kandor







. By the time she arrives on Earth, Kara is in her early 20's (as referenced in JSA Classified, her age at arrival has been 
retconned to about eighteen).


In 
Showcase #97, Kara is reclaimed by the sentient Symbioship and reimmersed into Kandorian society for a time.  Several years of virtual time elapse, in which Kara is married and has a child. She is freed with the assistance of newspaper reporter Andrew Vinson, at which point she disables the ship.




Debut of Power Girl





Power Girl's first appearance in All Star Comics #58, layout by Ric Estrada, inks by 

Wally Wood
.



Power Girl's existence is not revealed to the general public until much later; her cousin 


Clark

 and his wife 










Lois Lane









 provide her a family environment to assist her transition towards real life relationships.  In her first recorded adventure, Kara assists Justice Society members 


Flash

 and 
Wildcat with containing an artificially induced volcanic eruption in China.  She then joins 
























Robin























 and 
Star-Spangled Kid to form a Super Squad to assist the Justice Society in defeating 
Brainwave and 


Per Degaton

.  Later, she becomes a full member of the Society when Superman retires from active membership.


Having been raised by the Symbioship with artificial Kryptonian life experiences, Power Girl finds it difficult to adapt to life on Earth.  However, with the help of reporter Andrew Vinson, she adopts the 
secret identity of computer 
programmer Karen Starr (she obtains her knowledge in this field from exposure to 
Wonder Woman's 
Purple Ray on 









Paradise Island








).  On Earth-Two, Power Girl's closest friend is 





Helena Wayne




 (the 

Huntress
), the daughter of the Earth-Two 
Batman and 



























Catwoman


























.




Atlantean


The 1985 
limited series 

Crisis on Infinite Earths
 erased the existence of the Earth-Two Superman, and Power Girl's 
continuity was thus substantially disrupted.1 Initially she believed herself to be Superman's cousin, as she had been before the 
reboot.  However, her background was 
retconned; she was told that she was the descendant of the 

Atlantean
 sorcerer 











Arion










, and was frozen in 
suspended animation for millennia until the present day.2 


After the Justice Society disbands, Power Girl would join the Justice League. Later, while a member of 

Justice League Europe
, she suffers a near fatal injury while battling a mystical being. Superman must assist in her medical treatment, using his heat-vision to perform surgery on her otherwise-invulnerable tissues. Although she recovers, Power Girl is significantly weaker, as she lost her vision powers and could not fly for a time.


During the 1994 event, 















Zero Hour''














, Power Girl experiences a mystical pregnancy and gives birth to a son, Equinox, who ages rapidly. He disappears, and has never been mentioned again.


Power Girl appeared in later issues of the 










Sovereign Seven









, 


Chris Claremont

's creator-owned comic book for DC.  However, the final issue revealed that the entire series had been a story appearing in a comic book, and events in the book have had no bearing upon DC continuity.


Power Girl was one of 
































Oracle s































 first 

agents
. Their short-lived partnership ended after a disastrous mission which resulted in a large loss of life. Power Girl believes that Oracle's poor leadership was responsible for the tragedy. Although she has worked with her again on a few occasions when needed, the relationship between the two is tense. In Birds of Prey #35, Power Girl admitted that she is primarily to blame for the tension, but is unable to overcome the memories of the deaths.


Power Girl is a key member of the Justice Society, which she joined when it was reformed in the late 1990s. During an adventure with the JSA, she meets Arion who reveals her Atlantean heritage to be a lie he concocted at the behest of Power Girl's  mother .3




Infinite Crisis





Main article: 















Infinite Crisis




















JSA Classified: Power Trip''



The 
Psycho-Pirate shows Kara multiple origins in an effort to drive her insane.  He reveals that the Kryptonian origin is her true origin: Power Girl is not only a survivor of Krypton, she is the only other person from Earth-Two to have survived the Crisis on Infinite Earths (aside from Psycho-Pirate himself). How she survived and retained her pre-Crisis origin is unclear, since other redundant Earth-Two figures, such as the Huntress and Robin, did not. Power Girl's survival is possibly connected to the fact that Kal-L, the surviving relative from her Earth-Two existence remained alive in the 
Alexander Luthor-created  paradise  dimension until the 2006 series Infinite Crisis.4




The other survivors


In the pages of Infinite Crisis, Kal-L himself returns to the post-Crisis DC Universe after breaking down the walls of the paradise dimension5 in which he, Lois Lane Kent, 
Alexander Luthor, Jr., and 


Superboy-Prime

 had been living since the end of Crisis on Infinite Earths.6 Appalled by the rapidly-deteriorating state of affairs on the contemporary Earth, their goal is to replace the post-Crisis planet with a recreated Earth-Two. Kal-L s first order of business is to track down Power Girl and explain the events of the original Crisis to her. He also reiterates her pre-Crisis history as his cousin. A touch from the ailing Lois of Earth-Two inexplicably restores Power Girl's memories of Earth-Two.7


Soon after this revelation, Power Girl is confronted by Superboy-Prime, who renders her unconscious.8  She is attached to a  tuning fork,  a device controlled by Alex Luthor whose purpose is to bring back the multiple Earths. Alex Luthor and Psycho Pirate coerce 
Black Adam (who is also attached to the machine) into saying  SHAZAM!,  and use the 

now-raw magical energy
 to power the tower.9 After the reappearance of Earth-Two, everyone associated with that Earth is transported onto it (although Power Girl remains on Earth-One because of her proximity to the tower).


After being brought to Earth-Two by Kal-L, Lois Lane Kent collapses and dies. A violent confrontation between the two Supermen ensues, at the end of which Kal-L comes to the realization that Earth-Two had not been a perfect world, since  a perfect earth doesn't need a Superman. 10


Power Girl is freed by 





Wonder Girl




 and 






Kon-El





, and joins them in fighting Superboy-Prime and Alex Luthor. During a savage battle on 
Mogo, Superboy-Prime beats Kal-L to death and is later subdued by Kal-El. Power Girl is brought to Mogo by the 

Green Lantern Corps
 just in time to bid a tearful farewell to her dying cousin.11



Following the events of Infinite Crisis'', a new multiverse is created.  Among them is an Earth-2, from which Power Girl and Superman are both missing.12





One Year Later

Ed Benes
.



In a  One Year Later  storyline in Supergirl, Kara takes up the mantle of 











Nightwing










 in an attempt to free the natives of 








Kandor







. 


Ultraman

, masquerading as 

Kal-El
 and working in concert with the 
Saturn Queen, has taken control of the bottle city. 


Kara Zor-El

 is the city's 
Flamebird; she prevents Ultraman's forces from executing the captured Power Girl.13  Power Girl is forced to leave Kandor with Kara (against her better judgment) after Saturn Queen reveals to Supergirl information about Supergirl's past and purpose. This causes another rift to grow between the two women, as Power Girl feels Supergirl left an entire city of people to suffer, all because of her own selfish desires. This animosity is still on display when she next encounters Supergirl.14


Power Girl remains a core member of the 

Justice Society
.15 The former JSA series concluded with issue #87 and has been relaunched; Power Girl is selected as the chairwoman of the team after 
Mr Terrific steps down. 


Power Girl is invited to rejoin 
































Oracle































's 

Birds of Prey
, but refuses, stating that she would do so only  when 
Hell freezes over.   Her ill will toward Oracle is the result of a single mission in which she served as one of Oracle's agents, which ended badly.16 However, Power Girl does come to Oracle's aid against the 
Spy Smasher in Birds of Prey #108.


The recent appearance of the 
Earth-22 Superman (and his resemblance to Kal-L) has upset Kara greatly.


In Justice Society of America Annual #1, Power Girl  finally journeys to the new 
Earth-2, sent there by the Third World god 


Gog

 17, in a special issue drawn by 

All-Star Squadron
 artist 

Jerry Ordway
. Gog's good will however may have been foiled as Power Girl faces someone who appears to be her New Earth-2 doppelganger,  pitting the  Original Earth-Two  Power Girl against the New Earth-2 Justice Society and 
Infinitors, now collectively known as the 
Justice Society Infinity. Pursued by the heroes of this earth, Power Girl visits 
Michael Holt, in this reality a college professor, and asks for his help. 18


DC Comics has announced a new ongoing series that will reestablish Power Girl's secret identity of Karen Starr, as well as her software company StarrWare.  The book will be written by Justin Gray and 

Jimmy Palmiotti
 and drawn by 

Amanda Conner
.

Although Power Girl is a survivor of an alternate universe, her biology is similar to Superman's.  As one of a handful of alternate-universe characters who survived the 

Crisis on Infinite Earths
, Power Girl's abilities have fluctuated in the period after 1986.  For some time, Power Girl believed herself to be an Atlantean.19  At one point, Power Girl possessed telekinesis;20 at another she was vulnerable to attacks by earth and nature elements (for example, she was vulnerable to wooden weapons).  After sustaining severe injuries during her Justice League Europe membership, Power Girl retained only a degree of superstrength, superspeed, and enhanced durability. However, she later recovered her ability to fly, and writers have gradually restored her panoply of superpowers.


In Infinite Crisis #6, her powers are equivalent to those wielded by Kal-L; when Power Girl and Supergirl fight in Supergirl #2, they are evenly matched. Although Power Girl has displayed an occasional weakness to 
kryptonite, in Infinite Crisis #3 it is shown that the kryptonite available in the mainstream DCU does not affect Kryptonians from alternate universes, such as Kal-L or Superboy-Prime. 


In , Power Girl cannot be detected as a Kryptonian by some less advanced scanners which identifies Supergirl and the others as such.




Physical appearance and costumes



Power Girl's original Wally Wood artwork showed her as relatively busty but otherwise her figure and build conformed in appearance to other contemporary comic book women (see talk page for more information on the debate regarding Wood's depictions).


Power Girl was at one time portrayed as having a highly athletic but slender physique.  Artist 

Alex Ross
 restored Power Girl's extremely busty shape in the 
limited series 
Kingdom Come, rendering her as a heavily muscled Power Woman (as if an ardent 
bodybuilder). This approach has been carried forward by most other artists. Power Girl is consistently depicted as a 
curvaceous young woman, and her  is one of her most recognizable attributes   to the extent that various writers have acknowledged it in both serious and humorous ways.21


For example, Justice League Europe #37 attempts to explain Power Girl's revealing costume by having 
Crimson Fox question her about it; she receives the reply that the costume  shows what I am: female, healthy, and strong. If men want to degrade themselves by staring and drooling and tripping over themselves, that's their problem, I'm not going to apologize for it.   


Conversely, in JSA: Classified #2 (written by 

Geoff Johns
), Power Girl explains her cleavage-window to Superman, revealing that  the first time I made this costume, I wanted to have a symbol, like you. I just  I couldn t think of anything. I thought eventually, I d figure it out. And close the hole. But I haven t.  At the same time, however, the issue highlights the humorous element when a man who Power Girl has rescued is so fixated upon her chest that he doesn't even look her in the eye to thank her.  A similar treatment of the character can be seen in Superman/Batman #4  (written by 

Jeph Loeb
), in which the heroes need to distract the 
Toyman while Batman and Superman battle 

Captain Marvel
 and 

Hawkman
. Seeking a way to accomplish this task, Batman notes that their opponent is a thirteen-year-old boy, and all attention goes to Power Girl, prompting her response:  What's everyone looking at me for?  How am I supposed to distract... oh. 


The character's costume design has varied greatly over the years. Her classic costume design from All-Star Comics #58 is that which is in use today - a red cape and belt, blue gloves and boots, and a white bodysuit sporting a 

cleavage
-exposing window on her chest (its variable size and shape determined by the artist depicting her). During her time with Justice League Europe/America it transitioned to a capeless yellow and white 
bodysuit, followed by a blue and white costume with a short mini-cape, headband, with a diamond shaped opening on her chest. She has also worn a headband, as had 


Supergirl

 prior to her death in Crisis on Infinite Earths. In a guest appearance in 

Green Lantern
, Kara is seen in her large wardrobe closet with every costume design she has ever worn in DC continuity, deciding which costume to wear for that mission.  Her original costume returned when Geoff Johns had her rejoin the 

JSA
.




Other versions





Main article: 

Alternate versions of Supergirl


*The first use of the name Power Girl was a story in Superman #125 (1958). In this story, Lois Lane has a dream where she is a superhero named Power Girl who is constantly coming to the aid of a bumbling Clark Kent whom she dreams as a superhero named Power Man.22





In the final issue of 
52 (2007), a new Multiverse is formed, consisting of 52 identical realities; among the parallel realities is Earth-2.  As a result of 
Mister Mind  eating  aspects of this reality, it takes on aspects of the pre-Crisis Earth-Two.  The planet includes a Power Girl and other Justice Society of America characters; a newspaper headline announces that the Superman and Power Girl of this world are missing.23 Based on comments by 

Grant Morrison
, this alternate universe is not the pre-Crisis Earth-Two.24 As the 52 worlds of the Multiverse are altered versions of New Earth, it is possible Supergirl and Power Girl could exist as separate characters on a number of alternate universes.







In the 




Tangent Comics



 print, Powergirl is a genetically-engineered superheroine created by the Chinese government.







The graphic novel  features a version Power Girl who is an ally of that reality's 
















Black Canary















 and 

















Black Orchid
















. Though visually identical to her Earth-2 counterpart, her relation to Superman or her even being Kryptonian at all is never mentioned in the story.







 In 
Kingdom Come, Power Girl is renamed Power Woman, and assists her cousin Kal-El in reforming the 

League
.






In other media





Power Girl has not directly appeared in any licensed media other than DC's own comics.  A similar character, based on Power Girl, does appear in the 

Justice League Unlimited
 
animated series.  The character, 


Galatea

, is an evil 
clone of 

Supergirl
 created by scientists from 

Project Cadmus
 as a contingency plan in case the Justice League turned against America. However, although the clone resembles Power Girl and wears a similar costume, her personality and origin are significantly different.  Galatea's first appearance is in the season three episode  Fearful Symmetry  and is last seen in season four's  Panic in the Sky.   She was voiced by 

Nicholle Tom
 in all appearances.  Power Girl herself does appear as a member of the Justice League in the comic book adaptation of the series, also titled Justice League Unlimited, in issues #8 and #16.  


The character was referenced in the TV series 

Buffy the Vampire Slayer
. In the episode  
Killed By Death , Buffy notes that she fantasized about being Power Girl as a child.


The seventh season of the 
prequel show 

Smallville
 Introduces Kara Zor-El into its regular cast. Although implicitly based on the most recent iteration of the 


Supergirl

 version of Kara, her in-show origin contains an homage to Power Girl's Symbioship in the form of her diamond-shaped vessel being distinctively coloured red and keeping her in suspended animation while training her to assimilate into Earth culture en-route via a form of mental interface.

James Macnaghten McGarel-Hogg, 1st Baron Magheramorne, 
KCB (
3 May 
1823   
27 June 
1890) was a 











British










 
politician, Member of 

Parliament
, and local government leader.




Lord Magheramorne






Early life


McGarel-Hogg was the son of Sir 

James Weir Hogg
, Bt., the Administrator-General of 


Bengal

 and Chairman of the 
British East India Company, and was born in 

Calcutta
. His surname at birth was merely Hogg, but he added the surname McGarel on 
February 8, 
1877 on inheriting the estates of Charles McGarel, his brother-in-law.


He attended 

Eton College
 and 









Christ Church, Oxford








, a pattern of education which was a family tradition.  




Career


However he left Oxford early without taking his degree to enter the Army and became a Lieutenant-Colonel in the Life Guards, part of the 





Household Cavalry




. On retiring from the Army he went into politics, being elected unopposed as a 

Conservative
 MP for 




Bath



 in 1865.


He was also a member of St. George, Hamilton Square 
Vestry, a form of local government similar to a 
parish council. From 1867 he was chosen by the Vestry to represent them on the 
Metropolitan Board of Works which co-ordinated cross-London building schemes. He was defeated for re-election in Bath in 1868 and concentrated on his work on the Board, and after the death of 

Sir John Thwaites
 who had chaired the Board since it was created, he was elected as the new Chairman on 
November 18, 
1870. Hogg was elected MP for 
Truro in 1871 and retained that seat until he transferred to 




Hornsey



 at the 







1885 general election






.


His Parliamentary duties made it more difficult for Hogg to be a full-time chairman of the Board. While his predecessor had dismissed staff who he felt were not up to the job, Hogg used his influence to try to keep their jobs safe. Unlike Thwaites, he did not look in detail at the work of the staff but let them get on with their work. This meant that departments within the Board became either very efficient, or very inefficient. The Architects department was particularly noted for inefficiency.


Several of the Board's big schemes were just being completed when McGarel-Hogg's Chairmanship began. The 






Victoria Embankment





 had been opened shortly before he was elected, and he got to share in the rewards for the Board's successes, being made a 
Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1874 when the 





Chelsea Embankment




 was opened. Under McGarel-Hogg, the Board bought up all of the bridges over the 



Thames


 and freed them of tolls. However, the Board's desire for a new bridge by Little Tower Hill could not be fulfilled because its revenue source was not secure. 

Tower Bridge
 was eventually built by the 

City of London
 Corporation.


The Board also acquired the power to clear slums in 1875, but found the process cumbersome and expensive, resulting in small progress (although it accelerated when further Acts of Parliament removed some restrictions). Several parks were also bought by the Board and opened to the public. However, McGarel-Hogg's administration was hit by scandal in 1887 over the sale of surplus land, blighting somewhat the award of a peerage in the celebrations of 


Queen Victoria

's 
Golden Jubilee. A 





Royal Commission




 found officers and two members of the Board guilty of malpractice. This resulted in the decision to abolish the Board and replace it with a directly-elected council.


Magheramorne had fought for the Board to get permission to build a tunnel at Blackwall and it had been granted in 1887. The tenders for the contract came in early in 1889, when the 

London County Council
 had been elected but was not yet in control. He was determined to grant the contract through the Board and resisted the LCC's request that it leave the decision to them; however, when the LCC discovered the Board's intention to seal the contracts, they appealed to the Government and the Board was abolished on 
March 21, 
1889.

Selected papillomavirus types





Papillomaviruses were first identified in the early 20th century, when it was shown that skin 
warts, or 
papillomas, could be transmitted between individuals by a filterable infectious agent.  In 1935 

Francis Peyton Rous
, who had previously demonstrated the existence of a cancer-causing 
sarcoma virus in chickens, went on to show that a papillomavirus could cause skin cancer in infected rabbits.  This was the first demonstration that a virus could cause cancer in mammals.


It is now recognized that papillomaviruses are a diverse group of non-
enveloped 
DNA viruses that infect animals ranging from birds to 
manatees.123  More than 100 different 
human papillomavirus (HPV) types have also been identified.  Clinical aspects of HPV infection are outlined in the main article 
human papillomavirus.  The current article addresses the biology of papillomaviruses in general.


Papillomaviruses replicate exclusively in 
body surface tissues such as the skin, or the 
mucosal surfaces of the genitals, anus, mouth, or airways.4  Most papillomavirus types are adapted to infection of particular body surfaces.  For example, HPV types 1 and 2 tend to infect the soles of the feet or the palms of the hands, respectively, where they may cause 
warts.5


Cancers caused by a dozen or so  high-risk  HPV types kill several hundred thousand people per year worldwide and are a major focus of public health research.6



Taxonomy of papillomaviruses


Papillomaviruses (PVs) have similar genomic organizations, and any pair of two PVs contains at least five homologous 
genes, although the 
nucleotide sequence may diverge by more than 50%. Phylogenetic 
algorithms that permit the comparison of homologies led to 
phylogenetic trees that have a similar topology independent of the gene analyzed. Phylogenetic studies strongly suggest that PVs normally evolve together with their mammalian and bird host species, do not change host species, do not recombine, and have maintained their basic genomic organization for a period exceeding 100 million years. These sequence comparisons have laid the foundation for a PV taxonomy, which is now officially recognized by the 
International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. All PVs form the family Papillomaviridae, which is distinct from the Polyomaviridae thus eliminating the term Papovaviridae. Major branches of the phylogenetic tree of all PVs are considered as 
genera, which are identified by Greek letters. Minor branches are considered 
species and unite PV types that are genomically distinct without exhibiting known biological differences. This new taxonomic system does not affect the traditional identification and characterization of PV  types  and their independent isolates with minor genomic differences, referred to as  subtypes  and  variants , all of which are 
taxa below the level of  species .3




Animal papillomaviruses





Viral papilloma in a dog



Individual papillomavirus types tend to be highly adapted to replication in a single animal species.  In one study, researchers swabbed the forehead skin of a variety of zoo animals and used 
PCR to amplify any papillomavirus DNA that might be present.7 Although a wide variety of papillomavirus sequences were identified in the study, the authors found little evidence for inter-species transmission.  Interestingly, one zookeeper was found to be transiently positive for a chimpanzee-specific papillomavirus sequence.  However, the authors note that the chimpanzee-specific papillomavirus sequence could have been the result of surface contamination of the zookeeper's skin, as opposed to productive infection.


Cottontail rabbit papillomavirus (CRPV) can cause protuberant warts (see 
images) in its native host, the North American rabbit genus 
Sylvilagus. These horn-like warts may be the original basis for the  
urban legends of the American antlered rabbit the 







Jackalope






 and European 








Wolpertinger







. European domestic rabbits (genus Oryctolagus) can be transiently infected with CRPV in a laboratory setting. However, since European domestic rabbits do not produce infectious progeny virus, they are considered an incidental or  dead-end  host for CRPV.8


Inter-species transmission has also been documented for 
bovine papillomavirus (BPV) type 1.9 In its natural host (cattle), BPV-1 induces large fibrous skin warts.  BPV-1 infection of horses, which are an incidental host for the virus, can lead to the development of benign tumors known as 
sarcoids. The agricultural significance of BPV-1 spurred a successful effort to develop a vaccine against the virus.


A few reports have identified papillomaviruses in smaller rodents, such as 
Syrian hamsters, the African 







multimammate rat






 and the European 
harvest mouse.10 However, there are no papillomaviruses known to be capable of infecting laboratory 
mice. The lack of a tractable mouse model for papillomavirus infection has been a major limitation for laboratory investigation of papillomaviruses.




Evolution



The evolution of papillomaviruses is slow compared to many other virus types.  This is probably because the papillomavirus genome is composed of genetically stable double-stranded DNA that is replicated with high fidelity by the host cell's DNA replication machinery.  


It is believed that papillomaviruses generally co-evolve with a particular species of host animal over many years.  In a particularly speedy example, HPV-16 has evolved slightly as human populations have expanded across the globe and now varies in different geographic regions in a way that probably reflects the history of human migration.1112  


Other HPV types, such as HPV-13, vary relatively little in different human populations.  In fact, the sequence of HPV-13 closely resembles a papillomavirus of 
bonobos (also known as pygmy chimpanzees).13  It is not clear whether this similarity is due to recent transmission between species or because HPV-13 has simply changed very little in the six or so million years since humans and bonobos diverged.12




Structure






Papillomavirus capsid



Papillomaviruses are non-enveloped, meaning that the outer shell or 
capsid of the virus is not covered by a lipid 
membrane.  A single viral protein, known as L1, is necessary and sufficient for formation of a 60 nanometer capsid composed of 72 star-shaped capsomers (see figure).  Like most non-enveloped viruses, the capsid is geometrically regular and presents 
icosahedral symmetry.  Self-assembled 
virus-like particles composed of L1 are the basis of a successful group of prophylactic 

HPV vaccine
s designed to elicit virus-neutralizing 
antibodies that protect against initial HPV infection.


The papillomavirus genome is a double-stranded circular DNA molecule ~8,000 
base pairs in length.  It is packaged within the L1 shell along with cellular 
histone proteins, which serve to wrap and condense DNA.


The papillomavirus capsid also contains a viral protein known as L2, which is less abundant.  Although not clear how L2 is arranged within the virion, it is known to perform several important functions, including facilitating the packaging of the viral genome into nascent virions as well as the infectious entry of the virus into new host cells.  L2 is of interest as a possible target for more broadly protective 

HPV vaccine
s.




Tissue specificity



Papillomaviruses replicate exclusively in 
keratinocytes.  Keratinocytes form the outermost layers of the skin, as well as some 
mucosal surfaces, such as the inside of the cheek or the walls of the vagina.  These surface tissues, which are known as stratified 
squamous epithelia, are composed of stacked layers of flattened cells.  The cell layers are formed through a process known as 
cellular differentiation, in which keratinocytes gradually become specialized, eventually forming a hard, crosslinked surface that prevents moisture loss and acts as a barrier against pathogens.  Less-differentiated keratinocyte stem cells, replenished on the surface layer, are thought to be the initial target of productive papillomavirus infections.  Subsequent steps in the viral life cycle are strictly dependent on the process of keratinocyte differentiation.  As a result, papillomaviruses can only replicate in body surface tissues.




Life cycle



Infectious entry



Papillomaviruses gain access to keratinocyte stem cells through small wounds, known as microtraumas, in the skin or mucosal surface.  Interactions between L1 and sulfated sugars on the cell surface promote initial attachment of the virus.1415  The virus is then able to get inside from the cell surface via interaction with a specific receptor, likely via the alpha-6 beta-4 integrin,1617 and transported to membrane-enclosed 
vesicles called 
endosomes.1819  The capsid protein L2 disrupts the membrane of the endosome, allowing the viral genome to escape and traffic, along with L2, to the cell nucleus.2021




Viral Persitence



After successful infection of a keratinocyte, the virus expresses E1 and E2 proteins, which are for replicating and maintaining the viral DNA as a circular 
episome.  The viral 
oncogenes E6 and E7 promote cell growth by inactivating the tumor suppressor proteins 
p53 and 
pRb.  Keratinocyte stem cells in the epithelial basement layer can maintain papillomavirus genomes for decades.4




Production of progeny virus



The expression of the viral late genes, L1 and L2, is exclusively restricted to differentiating keratinocytes in the outermost layers of the skin or mucosal surface.  The increased expression of L1 and L2 is typically correlated with a dramatic increase in the number of copies of the viral genome.  Since the outer layers of stratified 
squamous epithelia are subject to relatively limited surveillance by cells of the immune system, it is thought that this restriction of viral late gene expression represents a form of immune evasion.


New infectious progeny virus are assembled in the 
cell nucleus. Papillomaviruses have evolved a mechanism for releasing virions into the environment.  Other kinds non-enveloped animal viruses utilize an active 
lytic process to kill the host cell, allowing release of progeny virus particles.  Often this lytic process is associated with 
inflammation, which might trigger immune attack against the virus.  Papillomaviruses exploit 
desquamation as a stealthy, non-inflammatory release mechanism.




Cancer



Although some papillomavirus types can cause cancer in the epithelial tissues they inhabit, cancer is not a typical outcome of infection. The development of papillomavirus-induced cancers typically occurs over the course of many years. 





Laboratory study



The fact that the papillomavirus life cycle strictly requires keratinocyte differentiation has posed a substantial barrier to the study of papillomaviruses in the laboratory, since it has precluded the use of conventional 
cell lines to grow the viruses.  Because infectious BPV-1 virions can be extracted from the large warts the virus induces on cattle, it has been a workhorse model papillomavirus type for many years.  CRPV, rabbit oral papillomavirus (ROPV) and canine oral papillomavirus (COPV) have also been used extensively for laboratory studies.


Some sexually transmitted HPV types have been propagated using a mouse  xenograft  system, in which HPV-infected human cells are implanted into 
immunodeficient mice.  More recently, some groups have succeeded in isolating infectious HPV-16 from human cervical lesions.  However, isolation of infectious virions using this technique is arduous and the yield of infectious virus is very low.


The differentiation of keratinocytes can be mimicked in vitro by exposing cultured keratinocytes to an air/liquid interface.  The adaptation of such  raft culture  systems to the study of papillomaviruses was a significant breakthrough for in vitro study of the viral life cycle.22  However, raft culture systems are relatively cumbersome and the yield of infectious HPVs can be low.23


The development of a yeast-based system that allows stable episomal HPV replication provides a convenient, rapid and inexpensive means to study several aspects of the HPV lifecycle (Angeletti 2002).  For example, E2-dependent transcription, genome amplification and efficient encapsidation of full-length HPV DNAs can be easily recreated in yeast (Angeletti 2005). 


Recently, transient high-yield  methods for producing HPV 
pseudoviruses carrying reporter genes has been developed.  Although pseudoviruses are not suitable for studying certain aspects of the viral life cycle, initial studies suggest that their structure and initial infectious entry into cells is probably similar in many ways to authentic papillomaviruses.




Genetic organization






Genome organization of Human papillomavirus type 16



The papillomavirus genome is divided into an early region (E), encoding various genes that are expressed immediately after initial infection of a host cell, and a late region (L) encoding the capsid genes L1 and L2.  All the genes are encoded on one DNA strand (see figure).  This represents a dramatic difference between papillomaviruses and 
polyomaviruses, since the latter virus type expresses its early and late genes by bi-directional 
transcription of both DNA strands.  This difference was a major factor in establishment of the consensus that papillomaviruses and polyomaviruses probably never shared a common ancestor, despite the striking similarities in the structures of their virions.  




Technical discussion of papillomavirus gene functions



Genes within the papillomavirus genome are usually identified after similarity with other previously identified genes. However, some spurious 
open reading frames might have been mistaken as 
genes simply after their position in the genome, and might not be true genes. This applies specially to certain E3, E4, E5 and E8 
open reading frames. 


E1:  Encodes a protein that binds to the viral 
origin of replication in the long control region of the viral genome.  E1 uses 
ATP to exert a 
helicase activity that forces apart the DNA strands, thus preparing the viral genome for replication by cellular 
DNA replication factors.


E2: The E2 protein serves as a master 
transcriptional regulator for viral 
promoters located primarily in the long control region.  The protein has a 
transactivation domain linked by a relatively unstructured hinge region to a well-characterized DNA binding domain.  E2 facilitates the binding of E1 to the viral origin of replication.  E2 also utilizes a cellular protein known as 




Bromodomain



-4 (Brd4) to tether the viral genome to cellular chromosomes.24  This tethering to the cell's 
nuclear matrix ensures faithful distribution of viral genomes to each daughter cell after cell division.  It is thought that E2 serves as a negative regulator of expression for the 
oncogenes E6 and E7 in latently HPV-infected basal layer 
keratinocytes.  Genetic changes, such as integration of the viral DNA into a host cell chromosome, that inactivate E2 expression tend to increase the expression of the E6 and E7 oncogenes, resulting in cellular transformation and possibly further genetic destabilization.  


E3:  This small putative gene exists only in a few papillomavirus types. The gene is not known to be expressed as a protein and does not appear to serve any function.


E4:  Although E4 proteins are expressed at low levels during the early phase of viral infection, expression of E4 increases dramatically during the late phase of infection.  In other words, its  E  appellation may be something of a misnomer.  In the case of HPV-1, E4 can account for up to 30% of the total protein at the surface of a wart.25  The E4 protein of many papillomavirus types is thought to facilitate virion release into the environment by disrupting 
intermediate filaments of the keratinocyte 
cytoskeleton.  Viral mutants incapable of expressing E4 do not support high-level replication of the viral DNA, but it is not yet clear how E4 facilitates DNA replication.  E4 has also been shown to participate in arresting cells in the G2 phase of the 
cell cycle.  


E5:  The E5 are small, very hydrophobic proteins that destabilise the function of many membrane proteins in the infected cell.26 The E5 protein of some animal papillomavirus types (mainly 
bovine papillomavirus type 1) functions as an 
oncogene primarily by activating the cell growth-promoting signaling of 
platelet-derived growth factor receptors. The E5 proteins of human papillomaviruses associated to cancer, however, seem to activate the signal cascade initiated by 
epidermal growth factor upon ligand binding. HPV16 E5 and HPV2 E5 have also been shown to down-regulate the surface expression of 
major histocompatibility complex class I proteins, which may prevent the infected cell from being eliminated by 
killer T cells.


E6:  The primary function of the E6 protein is to inactivate the tumor suppressor protein 
p53.  E6 also interacts with a large number of other cellular proteins and is a major focus of research.  Since the expression of E6 is strictly required for maintenance of a malignant phenotype in HPV-induced cancers, it is an appealing target of therapeutic 

HPV vaccine
s designed to eradicate established cervical cancer tumors.


E7:  In most papillomavirus types, the primary function of the E7 protein is to inactivate members of the 
pRb family of tumor suppressor proteins.  Together with E6, E7 serves to prevent cell death (
apoptosis) and promote 
cell cycle progression, thus priming the cell for replication of the viral DNA.  E7 also participates in immortalization of infected cells by activating cellular 
telomerase.  Like E6, E7 is the subject of intense research interest and is believed to exert a wide variety of other effects on infected cells.  As with E6, the ongoing expression of E7 is required for survival of cancer cell lines, such as 




HeLa



, that are derived from HPV-induced tumors.27


E8:  Only a few papillomavirus types encode a short protein from the E8 gene.  In the case of 
BPV-4 (papillomavirus genus Xi), the E8 open reading frame may substitute for the E6 open reading frame, which is absent in this papillomavirus genus.28 These E8 genes are chemically and functionally similar to the E5 genes from some human papillomaviruses, and are also called E5/E8.


L1:  L1 spontaneously self-assembles into pentameric capsomers.  Purified capsomers can go on to form capsids, which are stabilized by disulfide bonds between neighboring L1 molecules.  L1 capsids assembled in vitro are the basis of prophylactic vaccines against several HPV types.  Compared to other papillomavirus genes, the amino acid sequences of most portions of L1 are well-conserved between types.  However, the surface loops of L1 can differ substantially, even for different members of a particular papillomavirus species.  This probably reflects a mechanism for evasion of neutralizing antibody responses elicited by previous papillomavirus infections.29


L2:  In addition to cooperating with L1 to package the viral DNA into the virion, L2 has been shown to interact with a number of cellular proteins during the infectious entry process.  After the initial binding of the virion to the cell, L2 must be cleaved by the cellular protease 
furin.30  The virion is internalized, probably through a clathrin-mediated process, into an endosome, where acidic conditions are thought to lead to exposure of membrane-destabilizing portions of L2.20  The cellular proteins beta-
actin31 and 
syntaxin-1832 may also participate in L2-mediated entry events.  After endosome escape, L2 and the viral genome are imported into the cell nucleus where they traffic to a sub-nuclear domain known as an 
ND-10 body that is rich in 
transcription factors.21  Small portions of L2 are well-conserved between different papillomavirus types, and experimental vaccines targeting these conserved domains may offer protection against a broad range of HPV types.33

EUMETSATTM (European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites) is an intergovernmental organisation created through an international convention agreed by a current total of 20 European Member States: 

Austria
, 

Belgium
, 

Croatia
, 

Denmark
, 

Finland
, 

France
, 

Germany
, 

Greece
,

, 

Slovakia
, 



Spain


, 







Sweden






, 

Switzerland
, 
Turkey, and the 











United Kingdom










. These States fund the EUMETSAT programs and are the principal users of the systems. EUMETSAT also has 10 Cooperating States. Cooperation agreements with the 

Czech Republic
, 



Iceland


, 

Hungary
, 



Latvia


, 



Lithuania


, 

Poland
, 

Bulgaria
, 

Slovenia
, 

Romania
 and 


Estonia

 have entered into force. EUMETSAT was established in 
1983.

EUMETSAT's primary objective is to establish, maintain and exploit European systems of operational 
meteorological 
satellites. EUMETSAT is responsible for the launch and operation of the satellites and for delivering satellite data to end-users as well as contributing to the operational monitoring of climate and the detection of 
global climate changes. 


The activities of EUMETSAT contribute to a global meteorological satellite observing system coordinated with other space-faring nations.


Satellite observations are an essential input to numerical weather prediction systems and also assist the human forecaster in the diagnosis of potentially hazardous weather developments. Of growing importance is the capacity of weather satellites to gather long term measurements from space in support of climate change studies.


EUMETSAT is not part of the 

European Union
.

The national mandatory contributions of member states are proportional to their gross national income. However, the cooperating countries contribute only half of the fee they would pay for full membership. The contribution level are those published at end of 2006, for the mandatory programs.


Additionally, some member states may be approved to extend their level of contributions, to compensate for operational deficits. When such contributions are approved by the EUMETSAT council, or if the member states participate to the optional Jason-2 Altimetry program, they get additional voting coefficient rights (most members participate to the optional Jason-2 program, with the current exception of Austria and Poland).


Full member states of the organization have free full access to the images, data and other information produced by EUMETSAT. Cooperating states benefit from reduced fees for accessing the same data, but may get free full access in case of emergency or threats of meteorological disasters. Exceptionally, some non-member states, participating to the WMO, may get access to some data for the same reason.


Many poor non-member states around the world also get free access to Meteosat data, when their yearly gross national income does not exceed 3500 USD per capita, based on World bank statistics reports.1

 Geostationary satellites 




See

.






 Polar satellites 




EUMETSAT Polar System




See the 




MetOp



 article for the satellites.

While 
geostationary satellites provide a continuous view of the earth disc from an apparently stationary position in space, the instruments on polar orbiting satellites, flying at a much lower altitude, provide more precise details about atmospheric temperature and moisture profiles, although with a less frequent global coverage.


The lack of observational coverage in certain parts of the globe, particularly the Pacific Ocean and continents of the southern hemisphere, has led to the increasingly important role for polar orbiting satellite data in numerical weather prediction and climate monitoring.


From 2006, the continuous view of the Earth provided by Meteosat-8 is expected to be complemented by data from the first operational European meteorological satellite flying in the lower orbit   




MetOp



.


Positioned at approximately 850 km above 
the Earth, special instruments on board this spacecraft will be able to deliver far more precise details about atmospheric temperature and moisture profiles than a geostationary satellite.



EUMETSAT Polar System (EPS) satellites will also ensure that the more remote regions of the globe, particularly in Northern Europe as well as the oceans of the Southern hemisphere, will be fully covered.


The three MetOp satellites form the space segment of EPS. The first satellite, MetOp A (also called Metop-2, because it was the second satellite to enter production, but not to be completed), was successfully launched by a 

Russian
 
Soyuz rocket from 
Baikonur on 
October 19, 
2006, at 22:28 Baikonur time (16:28 UTC).


The satellite was initially controlled by 
ESOC for the 
LEOP phase immediately following launch, with control handed over to Eumetsat around 72 hours after liftoff. Eumetsat's first commands to the satellite were sent at 14:04 UTC on October 22nd, 2006.


Construction on the second satellite, MetOp B, has been completed. Launch is scheduled for 2010, with MetOp C launching sometime in 2014.

 Jason 





Main article: 






Ocean Surface Topography Mission







The Jason mission is in a planning stage and will eventually measure the 
altimetry of the global ocean surface.


Jason-2 is planned to fly at an altitude of around 1300 km. The main instruments on board are a 
radar altimeter, a 
microwave radiometer, and 
orbit determination systems. The aim is to measure the global sea surface height to an accuracy of a few cm every 10 days, for determining 
ocean circulation, 
climate change and 
sea level rise.


This program is funded separately and is not, for now, part of the mandatory programs for member and cooperating countries. Almost all members have joined this program and get additional voting rights.


Jason-2 was launched successfully from 

Vandenberg Air Force Base
 aboard a 
Delta-II rocket on 
20 June 
2008, 7:46 UTC.

Inequalities




Another inequality is called the 
Hermite Hadamard inequality.

In 
mathematics, Hadamard's inequality, named after 


Jacques Hadamard

, bounds above the 
volume in 
Euclidean space of n dimensions marked out by n vectors




vi for 1  le; i  le; n.


It states, in geometric terms, that this is at a maximum when the vectors are an 
orthogonal set; the problem is homogeneous with respect to 
scalar multiplication, so that it is enough to state and prove a result for 
unit vectors




ei for 1  le; i  le; n.


In this case it states simply that if M is the n times; n 
matrix with columns the ei, then 




|det(M)|  le; 1.


The corresponding result for the vi is therefore




|det(N)|   le; \prod_{i=1}^n ||vi||


with N the matrix having the vi as columns, and ||vi|| the Euclidean norm (length) of ||vi||.


In 
combinatorics matrices N for which equality holds, and the vi have entries +1 and  minus;1 only are studied; such an M is called an 




Hadamard matrix



.

Narrandera Shire Council





Narrandera is a town and 
Local Government Area (see 

Narrandera Shire Council
) in southern 




New South Wales



, 

Australia
.  It is an important destination for travellers as it lays on the junction of the Newell and Sturt Highways and it is the gateway to the productive 


Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area

.  Its strong history is reflected by the various historic attractions present in the town.


 History 





Main street






Narrandera is a River Town with a rich heritage. Captain 

Charles Sturt
, the famous explorer, is credited with being the first white man to observe the area that later was to become known as Narrandera. However Sturt, who passed through the district on 
December 12 
1829, was not the first explorer to cast eyes on the 

Murrumbidgee River
. The upper Murrumbidgee, the  Big Water , was first discovered in April 1821, by 




Charles Throsby



. The name Narrandera is probably derived from 

Wiradjuri
 nharrang, meaning  
frill-necked lizard .1


The 
Narrungderra were the local indigenous people. They were all but destroyed by settlement, disease brought by European settlers, and clashes with the settlers. The last major battle between the indigenous people and European settlers took place near Massacre Island, and is said to have left only one survivor.2


Narrandera had its first recorded mention as a pastoral station or  run  (Narrandera Run) in 1848, at which time the property held by Mr Edward Flood comprised approximately 76,800 acres. The Borough of Narrandera was constituted by proclamation dated 
March 17 
1885, and gazetted the following day. The centenary of Local Government in Narrandera was celebrated in 1985.




Narrandera today


The town of Narrandera is located on the 

Murrumbidgee River
, at the intersection of the 

Newell Highway
 and the 

Sturt Highway
 at the centre of a diversely productive agricultural region.  Its attractive tree-lined streets contrast with the open plains that surround it.  The central Narrandera Memorial Gardens include an unusual ceramic fountain made by 









Royal Doulton








 and erected as a memorial to World War 1 in 1922.


Narrandera now marks the transition between an extensive dry-land area devoted to cereal crops and sheep and wool production to the east, and, to the west, the 


Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area

 (MIA) fed by water from the 



Burrinjuck Dam


. The MIA is a region where irrigation has opened the way to a diversity of enterprise, from the growing of rice and other cereals under irrigation to the production of citrus, wine grapes and potatoes. 


The town also has number of historic attractions, such as the aforementioned Royal Doulton Fountain, located in the Memorial Gardens; a 
fig tree on the corner of King and Cadell Streets, which is thought to be 150 years old; and the Mon Repos, a residence built in a Queen Anne-style, which was built in the 1890's.3

The Football League
Defunct English football competitions




The Full Members Cup was an 

English
 
football cup competition held from 
1985 to 
1992. It was also known under its sponsored names of the 





Simod




 Cup (1987-89) and the 


Zenith Data Systems

 Cup (1989-92).

The competition was created after the 
Heysel Stadium disaster, when English clubs were banned from 

European competition
, as an additional competition for clubs in the top two divisions (but not the top six from 1984/85 in the 1985/86 season as these played in the Super Cup). The name came from the fact that these clubs were 'Full Members' of 
the Football League, with full voting rights. Teams from the lower two divisions were Associate Members and were eligible for the 




Football League Trophy



). However it was cancelled after 7 seasons, when the 
Premiership arose from the old 




Football League First Division



 and reduced the League to three divisions. Another competition, the 




Super Cup



 for the teams who would have qualified for Europe, was introduced at the same time and lasted only one season.

Eugenio Calabi (born 1923) is an 
Italian-American 
mathematician and professor emeritus at the 

University of Pennsylvania
, specializing in 
differential geometry, 
partial differential equations and their applications.

Calabi was a 







Putnam Fellow






 as an undergraduate at

Princeton University
, where his advisor was 

Salomon Bochner
. He later obtained a professorship at the 

University of Minnesota

Rafita asteroids




3600 Archimedes is a small 
main belt 
asteroid, belonging to the 
Rafita family. It was discovered by 
Lyudmila Vasil'evna Zhuravleva in 
1978. It is named after 


Archimedes

, the ancient 

Greek
 
scientist. 


Archimedes

 was also a famous mathematician who proved that the 
ratio of a 
circle's 
perimeter to its 
diameter is the same as the ratio of the circle's 
area to the square of the 
radius (we nowadays call this ratio 
 ).

Bronze Age



The Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (short PPNA, around 9000 BC) represents the early 
Neolithic in the 
Levantine and upper 
Mesopotamian region of the 



Fertile Crescent


. It succeeds the 
Natufian culture of the Epipaleolithic (Mesolithic) as the 
domestication of plants and animals was in its beginnings and triggered by the 
Younger Dryas.

The Pre-Pottery Neolithic A and the following 
Pre-Pottery Neolithic B were originally defined by 

Kathleen Kenyon
 in the 
type site of 








Jericho







 (Palestinian Territories). During this time, 
pottery was yet unknown. They precede the ceramic Neolithic (
Yarmukian).


10,200-9,200 BP (
uncalibrated) in the climatic phase Dryas II (arid climate).


There is evidence for the use of 
wheat, 
barley and 
legumes from carbonized 
seeds, but whether these seeds were collected, planted or even brought into the settlements as part of animal 
dung used for fuel remains the subject of debate. 
Sickle-blades and grinding stones certainly indicate the use of 
cereals. Some scholars speak of an 'agriculture predomestique'.



Settlements





El Khiam point, schematic drawing



The settlements consist of round semi-subterranean houses with stone foundations and 
terrazzo-floors. The superstructures were constructed of unbaked 
mudbricks with plano-convex cross-sections. The hearths were small and covered with cobbles. Heated rocks were used in cooking, which led to an accumulation of fire-cracked rock in the buildings. Almost every settlement contains storage bins made either stones or mud-brick. The sites are much larger than in the preceding Natufian and contain traces of communal structures, like the famous 
tower of Jericho, possibly built against floods. There is no relation to the biblical wall of Jericho that  came tumblin down. 


Around 8,000 BCE during the 
Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (
PPNA) the world's first town 








Jericho







 appeared in the Levant and was surrounded by a stone wall and contained a population of 2000-3000 people and a massive stone tower. There is much debate over the function of the wall, for there is no evidence of any serious warfare at this time. No battles were fought at Jericho. One possibility is the wall was built to protect the salt resources of Jericho.  1.




Lithics


The lithic industry is based on 
blades struck from regular cores. 
Sickle-blades and 
arrowheads continue traditions from the late 




Natufian culture



, transverse-blow 
axes and polished 
adzes appear for the first time.




Regional variants


With more sites becoming known, the archaeologists have defined a number of regional variants:



 'Sultanien' in the 



Jordan River


 valley and southern Levant with the type site of Jerich. Other sites include 
Netiv HaGdud, El-Khiam, Hatoula and 
Nahal Oren.


 'Mureybetian' in the Northern Levant. Defined by the finds from 





Mureybet




 IIIA, IIIB, typical: 
Helwan points, sickle-blades with base amenagee or short stem and terminal retouch. Other sites include Sheyk Hasan and Jerf el-Ahmar.


 'Aswadien' in the Damascus Basin. Defined by finds from Tell Aswad IA. Typical: bipolar cores, big sickle blades, 
Aswad-points.


 sites in 'Upper Mesopotamia' include 
Cayonu and 
Gobekli Tepe.

The Tank, Cruiser, Mk II (A10), was developed alongside the 

A9
, and was intended to be a heavier, 
infantry tank version of that type. In practice it was not deemed suitable for the infantry tank role and was classified as a  heavy cruiser . 



History and specifications


The A10 was developed by Sir John Carden of 


Vickers

 in 1934 by adaptation of the A9 design. The two sub-turrets present on the A9 were removed, and extra armour bolted onto that already present on the front and sides of the hull, along with all faces of the turret, providing approximately twice the armor in most areas.  


There was no separation between the driver's compartment and the fighting compartments. The turret armament consisted of a 

QF 2-pounder
 (40mm) gun and a coaxial 

.303
 

Vickers machine gun
. There was a 

7.92mm
 
BESA machine gun mounted in the hull in a barbette to the right of the driver. This was added to give extra firepower but at the expense of simplicity - the Vickers and the BESA using different ammunition. The tank had a total crew of five (Commander, gunner, loader, driver and hull machine gunner).


It used the same suspension and engine as the A9 and as a result it was slower than the A9. The A10 entered service in December 1939, but was something of an oddity - it had been intended to sacrifice speed for armour like an  Infantry tank, but was still relatively poorly armoured, and was, as a result, not effective. Production was ordered in July 1938, Total production was 175 vehicles including the 30 CS versions (see below), 45 were built by 
Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company, 45 by 



Metropolitan-Cammell


, 10 by 


Vickers

. In late 1939 another order was placed with Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company, this time it was a larger order of 75 vehicles.




Combat history


A number of Mark IIs were part of the 






British Expeditionary Force





 (BEF) sent to France in the early stages of 







World War II






. Their cross country performance was recorded as poor, but they were still used later in North Africa at the defence of 

Tobruk
 in 1941, where reliability and suspension performance in the desert conditions was praised. Sixty worn out examples were taken to Greece, by the 3rd 

Royal Tank Regiment
 and although they performed well against the German tanks, over 90% were lost due to mechanical breakdowns as opposed to enemy action (mainly tracks). (See  A Tankie's Travels  By Robert Watt ISBN 1-84683-021-4)




Variants



Tank, Cruiser, Mk II (A10 Mk I)


Classified as a 'heavy cruiser' and 31 were sent to 

France
 with the 
1st Armoured Division, but performed poorly in the following 

campaign
. Also served in the 

North African Campaign
 until late in 1941.




Tank, Cruiser, Mk IIA (A10 Mk IA)


The coaxial Vickers machine guns were replaced with BESA machine guns. Armoured radio housing added.




Tank, Cruiser, Mk IIA CS (A10 Mk IA CS)


Had a 3.7  (94 mm) 
howitzer in the turret instead of the 2 pdr. The standard ammunition load was 40 rounds smoke, and a few HE shells.

Mercury silvering or  'fire gilding'  is a 
technique for applying a thin layer of 
precious metal such as 
silver or 
gold (mercury 
gilding) to a base metal object. The process was invented during the Middle Ages and is documented in 

Vannoccio Biringuccio's
 
1540 book De la pirotechnia. An amalgam of 
mercury and the precious metal is prepared and applied to the object which is then heated, sometimes in 
oil, 
vaporizing most of the mercury. The technique is dangerous since mercury is highly toxic. Mercury silvering can be detected on through a variety of methods.

Modern chipped beef product, showing coiled packing






Individual sliver of chipped beef



Chipped beef is a dried, smoked, and salted meat product. The modern product consists of small, thin, flexible leaves of partially dried 
beef, generally sold compressed together in jars or flat in plastic packets. 

Hormel
 describes it as  an air-dried product that is similar to 
bresaola, but not as tasty. 1

Chipped beef is served in many diners and restaurants as a breakfast item.  Notably, most diners sell chipped beef on toast, particularly in the northeast United States.  Creamed chipped beef is standard fare on many diner menus, especially in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, but has become harder to find in chain restaurants that serve breakfast; among the restaurants still offering chipped beef on toast are 

Golden Corral
, and 





Silver Diner




.  

IHOP
 no longer offers this on their menus, having substituted sausage gravy, and the same is true for 

Cracker Barrel
 restaurants. It is also available from companies such as 




Stouffer's



 in a frozen form which can be put on top of separately-prepared toast; it is considerably salty in taste.  The mixture was also, at one point, available from both Freezer Queen and Banquet as  hot sandwich toppers ; as of Fall 2007, Freezer Queen has gone out of business, and the Banquet variety is rarely found.  Finally, several companies make a refrigerated version of cream chipped beef.  The meat itself is available for purchase separately as well.



Chipped beef on toast





Creamed chipped beef on toast



Chipped beef on toast (or creamed chipped beef on toast) is a 
foodstuff comprising a creamy sauce and re-hydrated slivers of dried beef, served on toasted bread.  In 
military slang it is commonly referred to by the 
dysphemism  Shit On a Shingle  (SOS). Chipped beef is also often served on English muffins, biscuits, homefries, and in casseroles.


Wentworth and Flexner cite no origin, but note that  shingle  for slice of toast has had  some use since c1935  in the U. S. Army, mostly in the expression  shit on a shingle,  and that the latter had  wide 







World War II






 Army use. 2


In the United States, chipped beef on toast is emblematic of the military experience, much as yellow 
pea soup is in Finland.  Chipped beef on toast (S. O. S.)  is, in fact, the title of a book of military humor.3 In his World War II book 




















Band of Brothers



















 
Stephen E. Ambrose evokes the military basics: 






 

 At the end of May, the men of 

Easy
 packed up their barracks bags and   [took] a stop-and-go train ride to 

Sturgis, Kentucky
. At the depot 
Red Crossgirls had coffee and doughnuts for them, the last bit of comfort they would know for a month. They marched out to the countryside and pitched pup tents, dug straggle trenches for latrines, and ate the Army's favorite meal for troops in the field, creamed chipped beef on toast, universally known as SOS, or Shit on a Shingle.4

 





In a 2004 story, 


Chuck Palahniuk

 talks about deprecated language in  the new and politically corrected Navy  where he says that in official theory, but not in practice,






 

 the dark-blue coveralls crewmen wear while on patrol are no longer called  poopie suits.  Crewmen who serve on the mess deck are no longer  mess cranks.  
Sauerbraten is not  donkey dick.  
Ravioliisn't  pillows of death.  Creamed chipped beef on toast isn't  shit on a shingle. 5

Fitzgerald Marine Reserve is a 
marine reserve on the 
Pacific Ocean, located just north of 
Pillar Point Harbor and 

Mavericks
 in the 

San Mateo County
 community of 

Moss Beach, California
. Moss Beach is located approximately 20 miles (32 km) south of 

San Francisco, California
 and 50 miles (80 km) north of 

Santa Cruz, California
, USA.  The reserve is a 32 acre (.13 square kilometer) holding which extends from 
Montara light station at the north to 
Pillar Point on the south. The reserve consists of a three mile stretch of beach, 
tidepool 
habitat, 
marsh, erosive bluffs, clifftop trail and cypress and eucalyptus forests.  The property is owned by the 

State of California
 and managed by San Mateo County as a county park and nature preserve.  The reserve is administratively assigned to be part of the 






Gulf of Farallones Marine Sanctuary





.  Adjacent to and possibly within the reserve is an endangered species of butterfly, 
San Bruno elfin butterfly. 



 History 






View of bluff trail looking north through cypress grove





The site of the current Fitzgerald Marine Reserve was originally settled by 


Native Americans

 approximately 5,800 years ago.  In 1908, the 




Ocean Shore Railroad



 extended through the town of Moss Beach, effectively creating this location as a tourist destination.  Remains of the foundation and some original landscape features from the Smith-
Doelger homesite from the early-1900s may be found on the bluffs overlooking the Reserve.


The site has long been a source of research and materials for marine biologists and collectors, so much so that, in 1969, San Mateo County urged the 
State of California to designate the site as a 
state reserve to protect the remaining 
flora and 
fauna. On 
August 5, 
1969 the site was officially designated as a state reserve and was named after 
James V. Fitzgerald, former mayor of 
San Bruno and a longtime member of the 
San Mateo County Board of Supervisors.




Natural features



The tidepool habitat has long been prized as one of the best such habitats in 


Northern California

.  It has been identified by the State of California as one of 34 such coastal habitats having  Special Biological Significance .  
Sea urchins, 
anemone, 
hermit crabs and many other 
intertidal species are prominent.


At the north of the reserve 



San Vicente Creek


 empties into the 
Pacific Ocean and has a diverse habitat supporting Red willow and other 
riparian species.  From a footbridge across San Vicente Creek, one climbs atop the bluff trail, which rises about 30 meters above the beach.  From there one has rewarding views down upon 
Frenchmans Reef, a rich marine ecological area.  Seaward the reserve extends to a depth of over 300 meters downward into the Pacific Ocean.  The reef is composed of the mineral 
Granodiorite. 


An occurrence of the rare plant 
Hickman's potentilla, Potentilla hickmanii was observed by E.C. Suttliffe in 19331 in the vicinity of the mouth of San Vicente Creek within Moss Beach. This colony was not further documented for decades, but another colony was discovered2 toward the end of the 20th century north of Moss Beach. The plant was listed as an 
endangered species by the 








United States







 government in 1998, and had previously been listed as California endangered in 1973.     


Sightings of the 
San Bruno elfin butterfly have been made adjacent to the Fitzgerald Marine Reserve in 
Montara.  This endangered species has very limited range and habitat.


The active 
Seal Cove geological 
fault(first mapped and named by Dr. William Glen in a 1959 publication of the University of California series in the geological sciences) forms much of the eastern boundary of the site.  Glen first suggested that the Seal Cove fault was a northward extension of  the San Gregorio fault. Submarine surveys later found that the fault  extends northward under the Pacific Ocean and presumably joins the 









San Andreas Fault








 near 
Bolinas.  The fault's trace was formerly clearly exposed in a sea cliff at the northern portion of the reserve, but is now obscured by cultural changes.




Details of habitats



The Coastal strand habitat lies between the Pacific Ocean and the upper edge of the beach or coastal marsh.  Species enjoying this niche are the 
California sea lion, 
harbor seal, 
Snowy egret, 
Great blue heron, 
cormorant and a variety of 
terns, 
murres, 
gulls and other shorebirds.  Within the 
tidepool area there are also 
sea urchins, 
anemone, 
hermit crabs and numerous other 
mollusks.


The flanks of 



San Vicente Creek


 and another unnamed drainage further south in the preserve are 
Coastal 
salt marsh habitat.  This niche is an important nesting and feeding area for many bird species including 
rails.  Since this marsh lacks 
cordgrass, it is a poor nesting site of ducks.  Dense pickleweed provides good habitat for a variety of 
rodents, 
reptiles and 
rabbits.


North of the salt marsh of Vicente Creek lies the 
freshwater marsh and 
seepage, which hosts a number of trees supporting bird-life and 
mammals.  The arroyo willow here is important to migrating 
warblers and other 
passerines.




Nearby features of interest



At the southern edge of the reserve lies the 









Moss Beach Distillery








, a California Point of Historical Interest, that has served as a clifftop restaurant since 1927.  To the east of the reserve is the Seal Cove Inn, a luxury 
destination 
country inn operated by noted travel author Karen Brown.

Teaching





Seminar is, generally, a form of 
academic instruction, either at a 
university or offered by a commercial or professional organization. It has the function of bringing together small groups for recurring meetings, focusing each time on some particular subject, in which everyone present is requested to actively participate. This is often accomplished through an ongoing 










Socratic dialogue









 with a seminar leader or instructor, or through a more formal presentation of research. Normally, participants must not be beginners in the field under discussion (at US universities, seminar classes are generally reserved for upper-class students, although at UK and Australian universities seminars are often used for all years). The idea behind the seminar system is to familiarize students more extensively with the 
methodology of their chosen subject and also to allow them to interact with examples of the practical problems that always crop up during research work. It is essentially a place where assigned readings are discussed, questions can be raised and 
debates conducted. It is relatively informal, at least compared to the 
lecture system of academic instruction. 


In some European universities, a seminar may be a large lecture course, especially when conducted by a renowned thinker (regardless of the size of the audience or the scope of student participation in discussion).



Origins of the word


The word seminar is derived from the Latin word seminarium, meaning  seed plot .

The Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSMEs) are the three main engines on the  
Space Shuttle orbiter. They are constructed by 

Pratt   Whitney
's 
Pratt   Whitney Rocketdyne Division.  The SSME is also designated as the RS-24 for engineering purposes.



 Introduction 


The Space Shuttle main engines burn 
liquid hydrogen and 
liquid oxygen from the 







Space Shuttle external tank






. They are used for propulsion during its ascent, in addition to the two more powerful 





Solid Rocket Boosters




 and sometimes the 
Orbital Maneuvering System.  Each engine can generate almost 1.8 MN (Mega
Newton) or 400,000 
lbf  of 
thrust at liftoff. The engines are capable of generating a 
specific impulse (Isp) of 453 seconds in a vacuum, or 363 seconds at sea level (
exhaust velocities of 4440 m/s and 3560 m/s respectively). Overall, a space shuttle main engine weighs approximately 3.2 t (7,000 
lb). The engines are removed after every flight and taken to the Space Shuttle Main Engine Processing Facility (SSMEPF) for inspection and replacement of any necessary components.


The Space Shuttle's 
rocket engines are capable of operating at extreme temperatures. The liquid hydrogen fuel is stored at  253 degrees 


Celsius

 ( 423 degrees 


Fahrenheit

). However, when burned with liquid oxygen, the temperature in the combustion chamber reaches 3,300  C (6,000  F), higher than the 
boiling point of 
iron. The main engines collectively consume 1,035 gallons (3,917 liters) of propellent per second. If the main engines pumped water instead of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen, an average-sized 
swimming pool could be drained in 25 seconds.


Apart from the three main engines, the orbiter has 44 smaller rockets around its surface, which are part of the 
Orbital Maneuvering System and 
Reaction Control System, used to provide steering, pointing, and altitude adjustment capability while in orbit.


The engines perform as follows: 
Fuel and 
oxidizer from the external tank enters the orbiter at the orbiter/external tank 
umbilical disconnect and then the orbiter's main propulsion system feed lines. There the fuel and oxidizer each branch out into three parallel paths, to each engine. In each branch, prevalves must be opened to permit flow to the low-pressure fuel or oxidizer 
turbopump.




Oxidizer system





Major components of the Space Shuttle main engine



The Low Pressure Oxidizer Turbopump (LPOTP) is an axial-flow pump driven by a six-stage 
turbine powered by liquid oxygen. It boosts the liquid oxygen's pressure from 0.7 to 2.9 MPa (100 to 422 
psia). The flow from the LPOTP is supplied to the High-Pressure Oxidizer Turbopump (HPOTP). During engine operation, the pressure boost permits the High Pressure Oxidizer Turbine to operate at high speeds without 
cavitating. The LPOTP operates at approximately 5,150 
rpm. The LPOTP, which is approximately 450 by 450 mm (18 by 18 
inches) , is connected to the vehicle propellant ducting and supported in a fixed position by the orbiter structure.


The HPOTP consists of two single-stage centrifugal pumps (a main pump and a preburner pump) mounted on a common shaft and driven by a two-stage, hot-gas turbine. The main pump boosts the liquid oxygen's pressure from  2.9 to 30 MPa (422 to 4,300 
psi) while operating at approximately 28,120 rpm. The HPOTP discharge flow splits into several paths, one of which is routed to drive the LPOTP turbine. Another path is routed to and through the main oxidizer 
valve and enters into the main 
combustion chamber. Another small flow path is tapped off and sent to the oxidizer 
heat exchanger. The liquid oxygen flows through an anti-flood valve that prevents it from entering the heat exchanger until sufficient heat is present to convert the liquid oxygen to gas. The heat exchanger utilizes the heat contained in the discharge gases from the HPOTP turbine to convert the liquid oxygen to gas. The gas is sent to a manifold and is then routed to the external tank to pressurize the liquid oxygen tank. Another path enters the HPOT second-stage preburner pump to boost the liquid oxygen's pressure from  30 to 51 MPa (4,300 psia to 7,420 psia). It passes through the oxidizer preburner oxidizer valve into the oxidizer preburner and through the fuel preburner oxidizer valve into the fuel preburner. The HPOTP is approximately 600 by 900 mm (24 by 36 inches). It is attached by flanges to the hot-gas manifold.


The HPOTP turbine and HPOTP pumps are mounted on a common shaft. Mixing of the fuel-rich hot gas in the turbine section and the liquid oxygen in the main pump could create a hazard. To prevent this, the two sections are separated by a cavity that is continuously purged by the MPS engine helium supply during engine operation. Two seals minimize leakage into the cavity. One seal is located between the turbine section and the cavity, and the other is between the pump section and cavity. Loss of helium pressure in this cavity results in an automatic engine shutdown.




Hydrogen fuel system





Orbiter main propulsion system




Fuel enters the orbiter at the liquid hydrogen feed line disconnect valve, then flows into the orbiter liquid hydrogen feed line manifold and branches out into three parallel paths to each engine. In each liquid hydrogen branch, a prevalve permits liquid hydrogen to flow to the low-pressure fuel turbopump when the prevalve is open.


The Low Pressure Fuel Turbopump (LPFTP) is an axial-flow pump driven by a two-stage turbine powered by gaseous hydrogen. It boosts the pressure of the liquid hydrogen from 30 to 276 psia (0.2 to 1.9 MPa) and supplies it to the High-Pressure Fuel Turbopump (HPFTP). During engine operation, the pressure boost provided by the LPFTP permits the HPFTP to operate at high speeds without cavitating. The LPFTP operates at approximately 16,185 rpm. The LPFTP is approximately 450 by 600 mm (18 by 24 inches). It is connected to the vehicle propellant ducting and is supported in a fixed position by the orbiter structure 180 degrees from the LPOTP.


The HPFTP is a three-stage centrifugal pump driven by a two-stage, hot-gas turbine. It boosts the pressure of the liquid hydrogen from 1.9 to 45 MPa (276 to 6,515 psia). The HPFTP operates at approximately 35,360 rpm. The discharge flow from the turbopump is routed to and through the main valve and then splits into three flow paths. One path is through the jacket of the main combustion chamber, where the hydrogen is used to cool the chamber walls. It is then routed from the main combustion chamber to the LPFTP, where it is used to drive the LPFTP turbine. A small portion of the flow from the LPFTP is then directed to a common manifold from all three engines to form a single path to the external tank to maintain liquid hydrogen tank pressurization. The remaining hydrogen passes between the inner and outer walls to cool the hot-gas manifold and is discharged into the main combustion chamber. The second hydrogen flow path from the main fuel valve is through the engine nozzle (to cool the nozzle). It then joins the third flow path from the chamber coolant valve. The combined flow is then directed to the fuel and oxidizer preburners. The HPFTP is approximately 550 by 1100 mm (22 by 44 inches). It is attached by flanges to the hot-gas manifold.




Pre-burners and thrust control system





Main Engine #1 being installed into an orbiter in one of the Orbiter Processing Facilities (OPF)



The oxidizer and fuel preburners are 
welded to the hot-
gas 
manifold. The fuel and oxidizer enter the preburners and are mixed so that efficient combustion can occur. The augmented 
spark igniter is a small combination chamber located in the center of the injector of each preburner. The two dual-redundant spark igniters, which are activated by the engine controller, are used during the engine start sequence to initiate combustion in each preburner. They are turned off after approximately three seconds because the combustion process is then self-sustaining. The preburners produce the fuel-rich hot gas that passes through the turbines to generate the power to operate the high-pressure turbopumps. The oxidizer preburner's outflow drives a turbine that is connected to the HPOTP and the oxidizer preburner pump. The fuel preburner's outflow drives a turbine that is connected to the HPFTP.


The speed of the HPOTP and HPFTP turbines depends on the position of the corresponding oxidizer and fuel preburner oxidizer valves. These valves are positioned by the engine controller, which uses them to throttle the flow of liquid oxygen to the preburners and, thus, control engine thrust. The oxidizer and fuel preburner oxidizer valves increase or decrease the liquid oxygen flow, thus increasing or decreasing preburner chamber pressure, HPOTP and HPFTP turbine speed, and liquid oxygen and gaseous hydrogen flow into the main combustion chamber, which increases or decreases engine thrust, thus throttling the engine. The oxidizer and fuel preburner valves operate together to throttle the engine and maintain a constant 6-1 propellant mixture ratio.


The main oxidizer valve and the main fuel valve control the flow of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen into the engine and are controlled by each engine controller. When an engine is operating, the main valves are fully open.




Cooling control system


A 
coolant control valve is mounted on the combustion chamber coolant bypass duct of each engine. The engine controller regulates the amount of gaseous hydrogen allowed to bypass the nozzle coolant loop, thus controlling its temperature. The chamber coolant valve is 100 % open before engine start. During engine operation, it will be 100 % open for throttle settings of 100 to 109 % for maximum cooling. For throttle settings between 65 to 100 %, its position will range from 66.4 to 100 % open for reduced cooling.







Combustion chamber and nozzle


Each engine main combustion chamber receives fuel-rich hot gas from a hot-gas manifold cooling circuit. The gaseous hydrogen and liquid oxygen enter the chamber at the injector, which mixes the propellants. A small augmented spark igniter chamber is located in the center of the injector. The dual-redundant igniter is used during the engine start sequence to initiate combustion. The igniters are turned off after approximately three seconds because the combustion process is self-sustaining. The main injector and dome assembly is welded to the hot-gas manifold. The main combustion chamber also is bolted to the hot-gas manifold.


The inner surface of each combustion chamber, as well as the inner surface of each nozzle, is cooled by liquid hydrogen flowing through 
brazed stainless steel tube-wall coolant passages. The nozzle assembly is a bell-shaped extension bolted to the main combustion chamber. The nozzle is 2.9 m (113 inches) long, and the outside diameter of the exit is 2.4 m (94 inches). A support ring welded to the forward end of the nozzle is the engine attach point to the orbiter-supplied heat shield. Thermal protection is necessary because of the exposure portions of the nozzles experience during the launch, ascent, on-orbit and entry phases of a mission. The insulation consists of four layers of metallic batting covered with a metallic foil and screening.


For a nozzle able to run at sea level, the SSME nozzle has an unusually large expansion ratio (about 77) for the chamber pressure. A nozzle that large would normally undergo flow separation of the jet from the nozzle which would cause control difficulties and could even mechanically damage the vehicle. Instead the Rocketdyne engineers varied the angle of the nozzle, reducing it near the exit. This raises the pressure just around the rim to between 4.6 and 5.7 psi, and prevents flow separation. The inner part of the flow is at much lower pressure, around 2 psi or less.1




Main valves


The five propellant valves on each engine (oxidizer preburner oxidizer, fuel preburner oxidizer, main oxidizer, main fuel, and chamber coolant) are hydraulically actuated and controlled by electrical signals from the engine controller. They can be fully closed by using the MPS engine helium supply system as a backup actuation system.


The main oxidizer valve and fuel bleed valve are used after shutdown. The main oxidizer valve is opened during a propellant dump to allow residual liquid oxygen to be dumped overboard through the engine, and the fuel bleed valve is opened to allow residual liquid hydrogen to be dumped through the liquid hydrogen fill and drain valves overboard. After the dump is completed, the valves close and remain closed for the remainder of the mission.




Gimbal


The 
gimbal 
bearing is bolted to the main injector and dome assembly and is the thrust interface between the engine and orbiter. The bearing assembly is approximately 290 by 360 mm (11.3 by 14 inches).


The low-pressure oxygen and low-pressure fuel turbopumps are mounted 180 degrees apart on the orbiter's aft fuselage thrust structure. The lines from the low-pressure turbopumps to the high-pressure turbopumps contain flexible bellows that enable the low-pressure turbopumps to remain stationary while the rest of the engine is gimbaled for thrust vector control. The liquid hydrogen line from the LPFTP to the HPFTP is insulated to prevent the formation of liquid air.




SSME thrust specifications


SSME thrust (or power level) can be throttled between 67 to 109% of rated thrust. Current launches use 104.5%, with 106 or 109% available for 
 abort contingencies. Thrust can be specified as sea level or vacuum thrust. Vacuum thrust will be higher due to the absence of atmospheric effects.





 100% thrust (sea level / vacuum): 1670 kN / 2090 kN (375,000 lbf / 470,000 lbf)


 104.5% thrust (sea level / vacuum): 1750 kN / 2170 kN (393,800 lbf / 488,800 lbf)


 109% thrust (sea level / vacuum): 1860 kN / 2280 kN (417,300 lbf / 513,250 lbf)




Specifying power levels over 100% may seem confusing, but there is a logic behind it. The 100% level does not mean the maximum physical power level attainable. Rather it is a specification, decided on early during SSME development, for the  normal  rated power level. Later studies indicated the engine could operate safely at levels above 100%, which is now the norm. Maintaining the original relationship of power level to physical thrust helps reduce confusion. It creates an unvarying fixed relationship, so that test data, or operational data from past or future missions can be easily compared. If each time the power level was increased, that value was made 100%, then all previous data and documentation would either require changing, or cross-checking against what physical thrust corresponded to 100% power level on that date.


SSME power level affects engine reliability. Studies indicate the probability of an engine failure increases rapidly with power levels over 104.5%, which is why those are retained for contingency use only.

 The SSME after the Shuttle era 





Main engine of a US Space Shuttle



Originally, the SSME was to see service in the post-Shuttle era as the main engines for the unmanned 

Ares V
 cargo-launch vehicle and as a second-stage engine for the manned-rated 

Ares I
 crew-launch vehicle.  Although the use of the SSME seemed good on paper, as it would use current Shuttle technology after the Shuttle's retirement in 2010, it had several drawbacks:





 It would not be reusable, as they would be permanently attached to the discarded stage(s).


 It would have to undergo a flight-readiness firing (FRF) before installation   the so-called  Main Engine Test  that NASA conducted with each new Orbiter and prior to the 

STS-26
 flight.


 It would be expensive and time-consuming to convert the ground-started SSME to an air-started version for the Ares I second stage.




With several design changes to the Ares I and Ares V rockets, the SSME will be replaced with a single 
J-2X engine for the Ares I second stage. The Ares V will use six modified 
RS-68 engines (which is based on both the SSME and Apollo-era J-2 engine) for its core stage.  Hence the SSMEs will be retired along with the Shuttle fleet.

Jacqueline, Countess of Hainault and Holland




Jacqueline of Wittelsbach (
16 August 
1401   
8 October 
1436, Dutch: Jacoba van Beieren, French: Jacqueline de Baviere) was Duchess of 
Bavaria-Straubing, 
Countess of Hainaut and 






Holland





 from 1417 to 1432. 


She was the only daughter of 
William VI, Count of Hainaut and Holland from his marriage (born after 16 years of otherwise childless marriage) with Margaret of Burgundy, daughter of 
Margaret III of Flanders and 


Philip the Bold

. 


Jacqueline was the last 
Wittelsbach ruler of Hainaut and Holland. Following her death, the estates passed into the inheritance of 



Philip the Good


.



History



Early life



Born in the 





Castle of Le Quesnoy




 in 
Hainaut, Jacqueline, from the her birth, was referred to as  of Holland , indicating that she was heiress of her father's estates. With only twenty-two months (

Paris
, 
5 May 
1403) and again with four years (
Compiegne, 
29 June 
1406) Jacqueline was betrothed to 



John of Valois, Duke of Touraine


, fourth son of 

Charles VI of France
 and his 
Queen consort 








Isabeau of Bavaria







. Both children were brought up in the Castle of Le Quesnoy -Jacqueline's birth place-, the boy having been given into tutelage of his father-in-law, as he was expected to succeed as ruler there and not in any way in France itself. It was a happy youth with both given a very good education. On 
22 April 
1411 the Pope give her dispensation for the union and on 
6 August 
1415, when Jacqueline was just fourteen, she and John married in 
's-Gravenhage.


On 
December 15, 
1415 John's elder brother 







Louis






, the 










Dauphin of France









, died, and John became Dauphin and heir to the throne. John died on 
April 4, 
1417 (in 
Compiegne, of an abscess in his neck, though rumored to have been poisoned), and two months later, on 
31 May 
1417, Jacqueline lost her father.




 Marriage to the Duke of Brabant 



Acknowledged as sovereign in Holland and Hainaut, Jacqueline was opposed by her uncle 
John III, duke of Bavaria-Straubing and 
bishop of Liege but she had the support of the 
Hoek faction in Holland (the faction of the small cities and petty nobility in the County). In 1418, her uncle and guardian 



John the Fearless


, 
duke of Burgundy, organized her marriage to her cousin 


John IV, Duke of Brabant

 and Limbourg. The ceremony took place in the city of 

The Hague
, on 
18 April of that year.


The marriage brought no happiness to her. He was two years younger, spoilt and weak. It was at this time that Jacqueline's troubles with her uncle John of Bavaria began when he claimed her counties and fuelled the civil war between the political factions.


By the mediation of John the Fearless, a treaty of partition was concluded in 1419 between Jacqueline and John III of Bavaria; but it was merely a truce, and the contest between uncle and niece soon began again and continued with varying success until the death of John III in 1425. 


When she realised she was without the support of both her husband and her mother while still confronted by the continuous opposition of her uncle, she fled to England. On arrival it was 





















Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester




















, the younger brother of King 

Henry V
, who welcomed her. He was thirty, unmarried and, according to an English chronicle, 'exceeded any monarch in knowledge'.


Having finally left her husband - due to personal and political disagreements between the two - and fled to the 

Kingdom of England
 by the invitation of 

 Henry V
, Jacqueline's marriage with John of Brabant was declared illegal and she obtained a divorce from 
Avignon Pope Benedict XIII (
7 March 
1422).


It was the English king Henry V who prevented her from marrying the Duke of Gloucester. Nevertheless, she was an honoured guest and, when the future Henry VI was born, Jacqueline was one of the godparents.




 Marriage to the Duke of Gloucester and its aftermath 



It was only after the unexpected death of Henry V in 1422 that Jacqueline and 





















Humphrey




















 married. However, as not all rules were observed, this was in haste so that the marriage was secret, in the town of 

Hadleigh, Essex
 before 
7 March 
1423. On 1424, Jacqueline gave birth a stillborn child. This was her only offspring from all her marriages. 


She had hoped that Humphrey would restore her to her counties but, being regent in England, he was occupied with affairs of state. Then her situation changed as, on 
6 January 
1425, her uncle John of Bavaria died, the victim of poisoning.


At the end of that year Humphrey, with an army, moved to The Netherlands but was soon embroiled in politics between England and France as well as between the opposing Burgundians and Armagnacs. Soon Humphrey began to distance himself from her cause. The army in order to press their claim to Jacqueline's lands, where she was now opposed by her former husband, John of Brabant. On 
13 February 
1425 Humphrey deserted his wife, who found herself obliged to submit to her cousin, 



Philip the Good


, 


Duke of Burgundy

, after being besieged in the city of 
Mons in Hainault.  Jacqueline was placed under house arrest in the chateau of 

Ghent
.


In the continual factional fighting, Gerard van Poelgeest, a follower of Jacqueline, besieged the city and castle of Schoonhoven. Once the city was taken, it took another six weeks before the castle was forced to surrender. He allowed all occupants, except Allairt Beylinc, to go free. Having a personal grudge against Allart Beylinc, he dictated that Beylinc could ransom himself for 1000 schilden and was given seven months to bring the amount together. However, once the seven months had passed, Allairt Beylinc, having failed, returned expecting to be imprisoned; but that night Poelgeest had him buried alive.


Humphrey, having lost interest in Jacqueline and her counties, then returned to England and consoled himself with Eleanor Cobham, Jacqueline's lady-in-waiting, while Jacqueline was imprisoned by Philip the Good. However, when it was rumoured that she was to be taken to 





Lille




 or even as far as Savoy, two knights came to her rescue. Visiting her, they brought her men's clothing and, thus disguised, she was able to pass unnoticed by the guards.


At the end of 1425 Humphrey sent a fleet of twenty-four ships containing an army of 2,000 men under command of Lord FitzWalter. However, the cities in Zeeland were not prepared to assist and Jacqueline had no army to come to their assistance. In the meantime, Philip the Good had been prepared and, on 
13 January 
1426, started his attack on the main force. The English forces were annihilated and only the knights were not killed as they would secure a ransom. This victory placed Zeeland securely into Philippe's hands. On 
27 February 
1426 Pope Martin V decreed that Jacqueline was still the wife of John IV, Duke of Brabant, and this released Humphrey from his obligations to come to her aid.


John of Brabant now mortgaged the two counties of Holland and Zeeland to Philip, who assumed their protectorate. Jacqueline, however, escaped from the chateau, disguised as a soldier, and for three years struggled gallantly to maintain herself in Holland against the united efforts of Philip the Good, John of Brabant, and the cities of the 
Hook faction.  


From then onwards Jacqueline was involved with skirmishes with the Burgundian forces. Although she might win, her victories were never decisive. On 
17 April 
1427, John IV, Duke of Brabant, died, which did not reduce her marital problems. 
Pope Martin V decreed that her marriage to John IV had been valid, thus confirming that her marriage to Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, was in fact null and void (
9 July 
1428). Within months Humphrey married with his mistress, Eleanor Cobham.


Without allies, and with Philip the Good applying further pressure to her, Jacqueline realised she had no chance of regaining her counties and, on 
3 July 
1428,  The Reconciliation of Delft  (de Zoen van Delft) was signed between Jacqueline and Philip. By this treaty, Jacqueline kept her titles of Countess of Holland, Zeeland and Hainault, but the administration was placed in the hands of Philip, who was also appointed as her heir in case she died without children. Also she was not allowed to marry without the permission of her mother, Philip and the three counties.


With this treaty, Jacqueline gained more than what she could have expected. Although was sovereign in name early, her image appeared with Philip's on the coins of her territory while some of her followers were given prominent positions. There was to be a council of nine which ruled her counties, of which she was to be allowed to appoint three. From now as her life was empty she merely travelled through her counties.




 Final Days 


In 1430 Philip the Good mortgaged Holland and Zeeland to the Borselen family, who placed the head of the family, Francis, Lord of Borselen ( Frank van Borselen ), in charge of her finances. Francis had been one of her opponents in the past; nonetheless, in 1432, they secretly married, and attempted to foment a rebellion in Holland against Burgundian rule. In response to this, however, Philip invaded Holland and threw Borselen into prison.  Only on the condition that Jacqueline abdicated her estates in his favour would Philip allow Jacqueline her liberty and recognize her marriage with Borselen.  She submitted in April 1432, retaining her title of duchess in Bavaria, and lived on her husband's estates in retirement. Jacqueline thus renounced her titles and became known as Duchess in Bavaria, of Holland, Countess of Oostervant. On 
1 March 
1434 Jacqueline and Frank van Borselen were married in the church of St. Maartensdijk and Philip gave Frank the title of Count of Oostervant also.


Her marriage with Frank van Borselen was happy but, in the summer of 1436, it became obvious that she was gravely ill. Jacqueline died of  consumption  (presumably 
tuberculosis)1 in 
Teilingen Castle on 
8 October 
1436, and since she had no children, Philip of Burgundy inherited Hainaut and Holland. Her husband Frank survived her thirty-four years.





Notes





Some sources cited she was murdered, possibly by orders of her cousin Philip the Good.

Knoxville College is a 
historically black college in 








Mechanicsville







, 

Knoxville
, 





Tennessee




, founded in 1875 by the 

United Presbyterian Church of North America
.  At first it offered 
education in grades 1 through 12 to prepare 
freedmen for higher education; by 1931 the 
high school-level 
Academy was disbanded, leaving Knoxville College a four-year institution of higher education. Knoxville College is a 
United Negro College Fund member school.


 History 


In 1862, the Reverend O.S. McKee, under the auspices of the Freedmen's Mission of the 


United Presbyterian Church

, founded the 
McKee School in 
Nashville, the first organized school for Negroes in Tennessee. The church soon established similar 
missionary schools for 
blacks in 

Mississippi
, 





Louisiana




, 





Alabama




, and 

Georgia
.


In 1872, the 
General Assembly of the church resolved to discontinue support of the schools in order to establish a college where blacks might prepare for ministerial and teaching careers. Two years later, the church selected Knoxville to be the site of the college as the black residents of the city expressed interest in education and the city was strategically located between existent centers of black education, Nashville and 
Atlanta.


In 1875, Knoxville College began operation in a former freedmen's elementary school. The following year, the college moved to a permanent location on a hill northwest of and overlooking downtown Knoxville. In 1878, only 174 of the student population studied on a level equivalent to or above that of a college freshman.


During the 1880s, black legislators obtained state scholarships for military cadets at the college. During 1890 1909, the college served as the Industrial Department for black students of the 

University of Tennessee
 in order to acquire funds for the scientific and industrial education of blacks, authorized by the 
Second Morrill Act.


In 1914, the 
College of Arts and Sciences was established. From 1920 to 1950, the 
normal school was emphasized giving to the school the distinction of being the leading supplier of teachers to black schools in 


East Tennessee

. Since 1950, the College of Arts and Sciences has been emphasized including the implementation of community service programs and dramatic productions.


In 1954, the college charter was amended in order to allow formally the admission of white students, although the children of some white faculty members had previously attended the college. In 1957, the college was one of the first group of predominantly black institutions admitted to full membership in the 
Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). In 1979, the church deeded the title for the college property to the 
Board of Trustees of the college.



Accreditation loss and legal issues


In 1997, the 
Southern Association of Colleges and Schools removed Knoxville College's 
accreditation.  In August 2005, the Board of Directors fired the college president, Barbara Hatton.




 The Tennessean newspaper article 


The July 6, 2006 edition of 

The Tennessean
 newspaper, based in 

Nashville, Tennessee
, reported a reversal of fortune. The article outlined that a year earlier, the college was down to about 130 students, couldn't pay its faculty or electric bills and was drowning in debt. However, according to the report, enrollment was rebounding with more than 400 students accepted for the 2006 Fall semester from more than 700 applicants. The faculty was being paid, the lights are back on, and the college's debts had been cut by about two-thirds, down more than $2 million.


 Oh, let me tell you it's the best problem in the world , Will Minter, an 







Oak Ridge National Laboratory






 official helping as a development strategist and fundraiser for the college, said of enrollment growth.  I'm happy to have one where we're overloaded. 


 We are miles ahead of where we were a year ago , said Ronald Damper, a Chicago businessman and chairman of Knoxville College's Board of Trustees.  We've had outstanding success in getting assistance from a number of people to get us to this point. The community has embraced the college. 


The Knoxville College Alumni Association, according to the article, was reportedly in the middle of a $1 million fundraising effort, while the college was engaged in a $2.5 million  Road to Success  campaign. Administrators said the college had paid down $2 million in debt, but still was $1 million behind. 




 Dormitory fire 


On February 19, 2007, Colston Hall (men's dormitory) caught fire. As a result of the fire two rooms were destroyed with smoke damage throughout the building. Knoxville Fire Department investigators determined that the fire was accidental and was not due to an electrical problem.12





 Campus 



The campus of Knoxville College is located on 39 acres, situated north of downtown Knoxville, in the city's 
Mechanicsville community. Its 17-building campus continues to be the primary institution for minority students in 


East Tennessee

. 


In 1989, Knoxville acquired the two-year 




Morristown College



 in 

Morristown, Tennessee
, which became Knoxville College-Morristown. The two-year school closed in 1994.


Knoxville College in partnership with the 







Pilot Gas






 station located adjacent to the campus (at the corner of Western Avenue and Middlebrook Pike), is revitalizing the Knoxville College Historic District.

European Union law




For industry and economic regulation laws, see 
European Community regulation.
A regulation is a 
legislative act of the 

European Union
 which becomes immediately enforceable as law in all member states simultaneously. Regulations can be distinguished from 
directives which, at least in principle, need to be 
transposed into national law. Under the European Constitution regulations would have become known as  European laws  but this proposal has since been dropped.


Legal basis


The legal basis for the enactment of regulations is article 249 of the 
Treaty establishing the European Community and, as such, regulations only apply within the European Community pillar of the European Union.




Article 249

:In order to carry out their task and in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty, the European Parliament acting jointly with the Council, the Council and the Commission shall make regulations and issue directives, take decisions, make recommendations or deliver opinions.




A regulation shall have general application. It shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.




A directive shall  be binding, as to the result to be achieved, upon each Member State to which it is addressed, but shall leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods.




A decision shall be binding in its entirety upon those to whom it is addressed.




Recommendations and opinions shall have no binding force.






Legal effect


Regulations are in some sense equivalent to  
Acts of Parliament of the Union , in the sense that what they say is law. As such, regulations constitute one of the most powerful forms of European Union law and a great deal of care is required in their drafting and formulation.


When a regulation comes into force it overrides all national laws dealing with the same subject matter and subsequent national legislation must be consistent to and made in the light of the regulation. While member states are prohibited from obscuring the direct effect of regulations, it is common practice to pass legislation dealing with consequential matters arising from the coming into force of a regulation.

Claude Percy Lemieux (born 
July 16, 1965 in 











Buckingham










, 

Quebec
) is a former professional 
ice hockey player active in the 

National Hockey League
 from 1983 to 2003. He is one of only eight players in NHL history to win the 









Stanley Cup








 with three different teams, and his 80 career playoff goals are the ninth most in NHL history. Lemieux is formerly the president of the 

ECHL
 
Phoenix Roadrunners.


Playing career


Lemieux was drafted in the second round of the 
1983 NHL Entry Draft by the 



Montreal Canadiens


. He played with the Canadiens from 1983 to 1990, winning the Stanley Cup with the team in 1986. 


In September 1990, Montreal traded Lemieux to the 









New Jersey Devils








 for 








Sylvain Turgeon







. Lemieux won the Stanley Cup with New Jersey in 1995. He also won the 




Conn Smythe Trophy



 that year as the playoff MVP.  


Shortly before the beginning of the 
1995 96 NHL season, Lemieux was traded to the 



Colorado Avalanche


 in a three-team deal that also involved 

Wendel Clark
 and 

Steve Thomas
. When the Avalanche won the Stanley Cup in 1996 Lemieux became only the fifth player in NHL history to win back-to-back Stanley Cups with different teams.


In November 1999, Lemieux was traded back to New Jersey in a deal which sent 

Brian Rolston
 to Colorado. He won his fourth and final Stanley Cup with the Devils in 2000. Later that year, Lemieux signed as a free agent with the 









Phoenix Coyotes








. 


In January 2003, the Coyotes traded him to the 



Dallas Stars


 for 









Scott Pellerin








 and a conditional draft pick. Lemieux ended his NHL playing career with Dallas at the conclusion of the 
2002 03 NHL season. Later in 2003, Lemieux briefly played for 

EV Zug
 in 

Switzerland
.


Throughout his career, Lemieux was noted for playing his best games during the postseason. On three occasions, he scored more goals during the playoffs than he did during the regular season (1985 86 with Montreal, 1994 95 with New Jersey, and 1995 96 with Colorado). Lemieux retired with 80 career playoff goals, eighth all-time in the NHL.


Lemieux also had a reputation as one of the league's dirtiest players; in fact, a recent ESPN special entitled  The Top 10 Most Hated NHL Players of All Time  ranked Claude first. While playing for Montreal, during a playoff game against the 


Calgary Flames

, Claude Lemieux bit Calgary's

 on the finger during a scuffle, prompting the Calgary winger to say,  I didn't know they allowed cannibalism in the NHL.  Lemieux's title of being a dirty player was solidified in a 1996 incident with the Avalanche when he violently checked 

Kris Draper
 of the 









Detroit Red Wings








 into the boards during a playoff series, causing Draper to suffer a broken jaw, broken nose and broken cheekbone, all of which all led to Draper having reconstructive surgery on his face and also having his jaw wired shut for several weeks. Draper also suffered a concussion from the hit. This incident is generally believed to have sparked an often-bitter rivalry between the two teams that continues to this day.  Unhappy with his actions, the NHL suspended him 2 games, despite outcry from some fans who felt that Lemieux deserved a harsher penalty.


However, the Wings would get supposed payback for Lemieux's actions on March 26, 1997 when 

Darren McCarty
 attacked Lemieux and Lemieux just  turtled (kneeled and covered his head while being attacked) in what became known as the 













Red Wings-Avalanche brawl 1997












. Lemieux fought again with McCarty immediately following the opening puck drop at a game at Joe Louis Arena.


Claude Lemieux has no familial relation to 


Mario Lemieux

, who was his contemporary in the NHL. However, Claude Lemieux's younger brother, 








Jocelyn Lemieux







, also enjoyed a lengthy career in the NHL.




Retirement


In 2005, Lemieux became president of the current incarnation of the Phoenix Roadrunners.


In 2007, Lemieux took part in the second season of the 
Spike TV television show 
Pros vs. Joes.


In September 2008, on 
RDS, Lemieux expressed an interest in making a comeback to the NHL.


In 2008-2009 he is currently assistant coaching his son's team named Lemieux Academy Bulls AAA PW.

Deewaar, or Deewar (

Hindi
:      , 

Urdu
:      ), is a classic 

India
n 
movie, directed by Indian director 

Yash Chopra
. Built upon the angry young man persona of 




Amitabh Bachchan



, the movie came at a time when the lofty heights of freedom movements were dashed by the stark reality of corruption that had steeped into society.  The story is unique because of the inherent moral ambiguity in the leading character; Bollywood films usually portray an unreal distinction between good and evil.


It is remembered for its powerful dialogue (
Salim-





















Javed




















) and performances by the lead actor 




Amitabh Bachchan



 who was ably supported by 



Shashi Kapoor


, playing the role of his younger brother. Amitabh Bachchan's character, Vijay Verma, is said to have been based on the life of the 

Mumbai
 
gangster, 
Haji Mastan Mirza.1  Deewaar followed 

Zanjeer
, another path breaking movie for 




Amitabh Bachchan



, though he lost the Filmfare Best Actor award to 
Sanjeev Kumar(

Aandhi
) that year.


Indiatimes Movies ranks Deewaar amongst the Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films.2  The film became a  superhit  at the box office in 1975, ranking in at number 4.3. 


The film was later, remade in 

Tamil
 as Thee (1980) starring 
Rajnikanth, 

Suman
 and 






Sripriya





, and 

Telugu
 as 
Magaadu starring 
NTR and Ramakrishna.



 Story 



The movie tells the story of two brothers, Vijay and Ravi Verma, who follow different career paths: Vijay is a smuggler and Ravi the policeman who is asked to hunt Vijay down.
Vijay Verma (




Amitabh Bachchan



) and Ravi Verma (



Shashi Kapoor


) are the sons of a trade unionist, Anand Verma(






Satyen Kappu





), who was defeated and disgraced by the management of his firm using his family as bait. A young Vijay's arm is branded with the words  My Father Is A Thief.  Unable to bear the public disgrace father deserts the family, and the sons are raised by their mother(


Nirupa Roy

)who brings them to 
Bombay City, who suffers the trials and tribulations of a poor single mother. Vijay Verma, the elder brother, grows up with an acute awareness of his father's humiliation and is victimized for his father's supposed misdeeds. In the process of fighting for his rights Vijay, who starts out as a boot polisher and becomes a dockyard worker in his youth, becomes a smuggler and a leading figure of the underworld.


Vijay sacrifices his own education can his brother Ravi does well as a student, eventually becoming an upright police officer.


Ravi romances Veera (


Neetu Singh

), the daughter of a senior police officer. Vijay has an affair with Anita(


Parveen Babi

), a woman he meets at a bar. When Anita gets pregnant Vijay decides to abandon his life in the underworld, not wanting to pass onto his son the humiliation he received because of his father. But it is too late. Ravi decides to arrest Vijay, notwithstanding their family relation. Their mother sides with the law-abiding son even though the decision pains her greatly. The two brothers clash. Vijay dies in the encounter and Ravi is presented a police gallantry award by the State.


There were several stereotype breaking characters in Deewar such as bar dancer Anita (


Parveen Babi

) with whom Vijay has premarital sex. This was considered taboo at the time. Babi was beautiful and Nirupa Roy's, performance (in a role earmarked for 
Vijayantimala) was memorable.


But Deewar clearly belongs to 




Amitabh Bachchan



. Gloriously rebellious, frightfully lonely and amazingly intense, his eyes seem to burn down everyone who crosses his path. The initial choice for 



Shashi Kapoor


 s role was 
Navin Nishchal, but he did not want to play the second lead.

Epidemiology




For other uses, see 
Gold standard (disambiguation).

In 
medicine, a gold standard test or criterion standard test is a 
diagnostic test or benchmark that is regarded as definitive. This can refer to diagnosing a disease process, or the criteria by which scientific evidence is evaluated. For example, in resuscitation research, the gold standard test of a medication or procedure is whether or not it leads to an increase in the number of neurologically intact survivors that walk out of the hospital.1 Other types of medical research might regard a significant decrease in 30 day mortality as the gold standard. The AMA Style Guide prefers the phrase Criterion Standard instead of Gold Standard, and many medical journals now mandate this usage in their instructions for contributors.  For instance, Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation specifies this usage.2


A hypothetical ideal gold standard test has a 
sensitivity, or 
statistical power, of 100% (it identifies all individuals with a disease process; it does not have any false-negative results) and a 
 specificity of 100% (it does not falsely identify someone with a condition that does not have the condition; it does not have any false-positive results).  In practice, there are no ideal gold standard tests.


Because tests can be incorrect (either a 
false-negative or a 
false-positive result), results should be interpreted in the context of the history, physical findings, and other test results in the individual that is being tested.  It is within this context that the sensitivity and specificity of the gold standard test is determined.


Quite often the gold standard test is not the test performed in a particular individual.  In fact, many gold standard tests are not performed in the clinical practice of medicine at all.  This is because the gold standard test may be difficult to perform or may be impossible to perform on a living person (i.e. the test is performed as part of an 
autopsy), or may take too long for the results of the test to be available to be clinically useful.


As new diagnostic methods become available, the gold standard test may change over time.  For instance, for the diagnosis of 
aortic dissection, the gold standard test used to be the 
aortogram, which had a sensitivity as low as 83% and a specificity as low as 87%.  Since the advancements of 
magnetic resonance imaging, the 
magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) has become the new gold standard test for aortic dissection, with a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 92%.  Before widespread acceptance of any new test, the former test retains its status as the gold standard.

The West of Scotland Cricket Club is a large 
cricket club based in 

Glasgow
, 

Scotland
.  Their ground is 






Hamilton Crescent





 lohttp://en.wikipedia.org/skins-1.5/common/images/button_extlink.png
External link (remember http:// prefix)cated in the 

Partick
 area of Glasgow's West End.

The current Chairman of the cricket club is the long-serving John Thomson.


The current First XI Captain is IDK Young.


West of Scotland, traditionally, are one of the working class cricket clubs in Glasgow and on a summer's day there can be quite a jovial, rowdy, yet well informed support on the famous banking. 


At the moment West boasts of the ultra talented, powerful opener Douglas Lockhart. Lockhart is a member of the Scottish National side as well as being an Oxford Blue and having had trials with Derbyshire CCC.


Another player to have played at county level is Gregor Maiden. His stint at Lancashire was injury plagued though and is now back in Scotland with Grange CC.


West has also produced an array of youngsters who have come through the ranks and now play an impressive level of cricket. Moneeb Iqbal now plays at Durham CCC and made his first class debut last year. In this game Iqbal took a stunning catch on the deep square leg boundary and it has been said that Iqbal is a favourite of Durham captain Michael Hussey.


Another player who came through the ranks of this prestigious club is IDK Young, Ian Young was a member of the MCC young cricketers programme and this stylish left-hander has played extremely well during his period at Lord's. Young returned to Scotland for the 2007 season and will captain the team in 2008. More notably Ian was twelfth man for the English test side when they played the infamous test against Pakistan at Trent Bridge in 2006.


Another product of the coveted West Youth system is Craig Wright, the ex-Captain of the Scottish national team. Wright left West of Scotland for Carlton CC due to work commitments. He has now moved back west to the controversial Greenock CC all-stars and captained them to SNCL Premier League Success in 2007.



2006 Season



West of Scotland Cricket Club were promoted to the SNCL Premier league following a final day nailbiter in 2006 and returned to the highest level possible for a Scottish club to play at for the 2007 season. Stand-out performances came from Scottish International Douglas Lockhart with 802 runs at an average of 57.29, Indian pro Barrington Rowland with nearly 1000 runs at an average of 56.24 and the experienced trundlers Mark Gilchrist and John Cameron who took a combined total of 56 wickets at averages of 15.97 and 10.88 respectively. Able support was provided by Ricky Windows, Aussie amateur Tim McKay and Gautam 'G' Hariharan. Young Gregg Watson also scored his first SNCL century with 103*. But we're back for 2009 baby!!!




2007 Season



Following the resignation of the 1st XI captain Mark Gilchrist the then vice-captain Gregg Watson took over and despite an unsuccessful season team spirit and morale was restored.


The season started poorly for the West with defeats to Uddingston and Ferguslie. However, in the Uddingston match, star opener Dougie Lockhart suffered a knee injury which was to put the powerful opener out for the season. However, Ian Young and Barry Rowland made encouraging starts on their return to West with innings of 63 (against Ferguslie) and 90 (against Uddingston). Then, in an all-Glasgow affair West restricted the Clydesdale heavyweights to 185-4 in their allotted 47 overs. However, as was to be the theme of the year, West subsided meekly to 120 all out.


They then recorded their first win of the season against southsiders 
Poloc by 17 runs, Barry Rowland in the runs with a superb 101, while Tim McKay supported with 58*. Ian Cran was the main wicket-taker with 3-45. However, seven losses and six wash-outs meant that West were already relegated by the time they recorded their second win, in a match against second-bottom Heriots on the final day of the season.


Ian Young has been nominated as Captain for 2008 with Douglas Lockhart as Vice Captain. The eleven will be chasing promotion back to the premier division next year.




Juniors



The current starlets of this junior system are members of a somewhat underachieving under 18s side. However, West has many talented players in its junior system, including 17 year old Cameron Gibb, 16 year old seamer Max Ralston, 15 year old pace bowler Gavin  Guvnor  Smith, Recently turned  Leg Spinner  to  Seamer  15 year old Chris Ross, Alfred  Alfie  Lloyd who's punishing drives, slog sweeps and cuts make bowlers of the calibre of Moneeb Iqbal sit up and take notice and 11 year old Andrew Umeed, who recently scored 147 in a district U12 tournament.  Within the last few years, the West junior section have delivered many things including the achievement of sending out an unknown year old playing U18s cricket by the name of Sunny Ahmed, who dared to go out to face the lightning pace of Scotland U17 bowling allrounder Craig Morrison without protection. Another household name of WOSCC is 14 year old Blair Moffat who memorably made his debut for the 3s in a hoodie and jeans after getting a late call from Captain McKendry. He was quoted as being (by Stewart Murray)  the most unathletic boy I have ever seen  after the  bounce  game which the Ferguslie opener took part in and subsequently ruined the spirit in which it was played.

Horse races in Great Britain
Open long distance horse races




__NOTOC__
The Goodwood Cup is a 
Group 2 
flat 
horse race in the 











United Kingdom










 open to 
thoroughbreds which are three-years-old or above. It is run over a distance of 2 miles (3,219 metres) at 

Goodwood Racecourse
, and it takes place annually during the Glorious Goodwood meeting in late July or early August.

The race was first run in 1812, and since then there have been several modifications to the distance. The most recent alterations were in 1990, when it was shortened by a 
furlong to 2  miles (4,023 metres), and in 1991, when the present distance was introduced. As the Goodwood Cup was reduced in length, the distance of the secondary staying race at the meeting   the Goodwood Stakes   was increased. Unusually for a flat race there are no starting stalls   the horses start near the winning post and removing the stalls in time for the finish would not be possible.


Together with the 2  mile 







Ascot Gold Cup






 and the 2  mile 







Doncaster Cup






, the Goodwood Cup is part of Britain's Stayers' Triple Crown. This is for horses capable of running longer distances. Only six horses have ever swept the series, and 
Le Moss is the only horse to do it twice. The race was promoted to Group 2 status in 1995, having been previously classed at Group 3 level.

This article is about the song. For people of the same name, see 
Tom Dooley.

 Tom Dooley  is an old 





North Carolina




 
folk song based on the 
1866 murder of a woman named 
Laura Foster in 

Wilkes County, North Carolina
. It is best known today because of a hit version recorded in 1958 (see 
1958 in music) by 








The Kingston Trio







.



 History 


Impoverished 

Confederate
 veteran  


Tom Dula

 (Dooley), Laura Foster's lover and probable fiance, was convicted of her murder and hanged in 1868. Foster was stabbed to death with a large knife; the brutality of the attack partly accounted for the widespread publicity the murder and subsequent trial received.


Dula had a second lover, Anne Melton. It was her comments that led to the discovery of Foster's body; Melton was acquitted in a separate trial based on his word. Many believed that Melton was the real killer and that Dula admitted guilt to protect her. This assumption was based on stories at the time that Melton was jealous of Dula's upcoming marriage to Foster, and that she had murdered Foster to eliminate her as a rival for Dula's affections. Thanks to the efforts of newspapers such as 

The New York Times
, and to the fact that former North Carolina governor 
Zebulon Vance represented Dula pro bono, Dula's murder trial and subsequent hanging were given widespread national publicity for the time. Further adding to the Dula legend was the fact that a local poet, 
Thomas C. Land, wrote a popular song about Dula's tragedy after the hanging.


A man named  Grayson,  mentioned in the song as pivotal in Dula's downfall, has sometimes been characterized as a romantic rival of Dula's or a vengeful sheriff who captured him and presided over his hanging. Some variant lyrics of the song portray Grayson in that light, and the spoken introduction to the Kingston Trio version did the same. Col. James Grayson was actually a Tennessee politician who had hired Dula on his farm when the young man fled North Carolina under suspicion and was using a false name. Grayson did help North Carolinians capture Dula and was personally involved in returning him to North Carolina, but otherwise played no role in the case.


Dula was tried in 

Statesville
, because it was believed he could not get a fair trial in Wilkes County. He was given a new trial on appeal but he was again convicted, and hanged on 
May 1, 
1868. His alleged accomplice, Jack Keaton, was set free.  On the gallows, Dula reportedly stated,  Gentlemen, do you see this hand? I didn't harm a hair on the girl's head. 


Dula's last name was pronounced  Dooley,  leading to some confusion in spelling over the years. (The pronunciation of a final  a  like  y  is an old feature in 


Appalachia

n speech, as in the term  










Grand Ole Opry









 ). 


The doleful ballad was probably first sung shortly after the execution and is still commonly sung in North Carolina. The song was selected as one of the 
Songs of the Century.


In the documentary Appalachian Journey (1991), 















Alan Lomax














 describes Frank Proffitt as the  original source  for the song. It is unclear exactly what Lomax means by this but, since it seems that the song predates Frank Proffitt's early version, it is likely that Lomax means that Proffitt's version is the one that has become most well known to us because the Kingston Trio derived their interpretation from Proffitt's. Certainly, there is an earlier known recording by Grayson and Whitter made in 1929, approximately ten years before Proffitt cut his own recording of the song.




 Recordings 

 
Several notable recordings have been made: 



 
Grayson and Whitter, 











Victor










, 1929. The first recorded version by a group well known at the time. 


 
Frank Warner, 






Elektra





, 1952. Warner, a folklorist, unaware of the 1929 recording, in 1940 took down the song from 



Frank Proffitt


 and passed it to 















Alan Lomax














 who published it in Folk Song: USA. 


 








The Kingston Trio







, 

Capitol
, 1958. This recording sold in excess of six million copies, reaching #1 on the 


U.S. Billboard Hot 100

, and is often credited with starting the  folk boom  of the late 1950s and 1960s. It only had three verses (and the chorus four times). 


 

Lonnie Donegan
, also 1958. This version charted in the 











United Kingdom










 simultaneously with the Kingston Trio's. Its uptempo 
skiffle style was a contrast to the U.S. version's slower arrangement.












Doc Watson








, 

Vanguard Records
, 1964. This version considerably extended the scope of the song. 










Rob Ickes






 recorded a version on his album  Hard Times  in 1997 as a Bluegrass-song. 



Macabre Minstrels recorded a song about Dooley on their 2002 EP . The Minstrels are a side project of death metal band 
Macabre who have released several albums, often themed around serial killers and murders of notoriety.





Parodies


Tom Dooley prompted a number of parodies, either as part of other songs (



Ella Fitzgerald


 drops an altered line from the song into a recording of 




Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer



) or as entire songs, including one called Hang Down Your Head Tom Dooley, Your Tie's Caught In Your Zipper by the 

Incredible Bongo Band
 in 1972.


The song and legend were parodied by a one-record novelty act called Waldo, Dudley and Dora on a 45 rpm 
Grayson Goofed, issued as Awful Records release #PU-1. Verses sung to the Tom Dooley melody alternate with mini-skits, as  John  Grayson's public reputation erodes from  a fine man  to  a stoolie  (i.e., stool pigeon) to  a gink .


The song was often parodied by the 

Smothers Brothers
 as Tom Crudely. 


In Episode #702 of 

Mystery Science Theater 3000
, 

Crow T. Robot
, motivated by one actor's resemblance to 
Thomas Dewey, sang a version beginning  Hang down your head, Tom Dewey. 





 Movie 


The Kingston Trio hit inspired a quickie feature film, The Legend of Tom Dooley (1959), starring actor 

Michael Landon
. The film was essentially a 





Western




 set just after the 

Civil War
. Despite the title, it was not about any traditional Tom Dula legends or about the facts of the actual case, but was a fictional treatment obviously tailored to fit the lyrics of the song.

Steamboat Creek is a short tributary of the 



North Umpqua River


 in southwestern 





Oregon




 in the 








United States







. Approximately 15 miles (24 km) long, the creek is located on a remote part of the upper North Umpqua in the 
Calapooia Mountains west of the 
Cascade Range. It rises in southeastern 

Lane County
 and flows southwest to join the North Umpqua from the north at 
Steamboat.


The North Umpqua and its tributaries renowned for its prolific runs of summer 
steelhead, including a high percentage of native fish. Steamboat Creek has been closed to fishing since 1932.


The watershed of the creek was extensively 
clearcut during the late 1950s and 1960s until forestry practices were changed. The recovery of the river, including the 
anadromous fish population is closely monitored as a test case for riparian habitat management.

Neko Majin (     , Neko Majin) is a short series of 
one-shot 
manga chapters by 

Akira Toriyama
, spanning eight total installments released from 1999-2005. It is most notable for its later portion, Neko Majin Z, which is a 
self-parody of 
Dragon Ball, the author's most famous work.



Introduction



Originally a one-shot bearing little relation to 

Akira Toriyama
's other series, the first chapter of Neko Majin appeared in 
Weekly Sh nen Jump in April 1999 (WJ #22-23). Though there were some similarities, it didn't become a self-
parody of the 
Dragon Ball 
manga until Neko Majin Z, which had cameos of characters from the author's magnum opus. As of 
2005, the series was completed with eight total chapters (five of which are Dragon Ball parodies). These chapters were compiled into a  kanzenban -style package for release in Japan on 
4 April 
2005. Recently, the first chapter of Neko Majin Z was released in an issue of America's monthly Shonen Jump magazine as a bonus to the special Dragon Ball collectors issue.

General information





Onio as a Super Saiyan





The series revolves around the adventures of various characters from the  Neko Majin  race, a group of cats that can use a little bit of magic, but seem to enjoy practical jokes and martial arts even more. It eventually spins off into Neko Majin Z, centralizing around  
Z , a cat-like version of 
Son Goku complete with 
nyoi-bo and typically Dragon Ball Z-style attacks, such as the  Neko-Hameha , an attack that the Neko Majin from the first chapter also used. Other familiar motifs show up during the course of the series, including 
Freeza's son 
Kuriza, a fat 





Super Saiyan




 named 
Onio (following the Saiyans' vegetable pun trend, this one is an obvious pun of onion), and even cameos by actual Dragon Ball characters 





















Vegeta




















, 

Majin Buu
, and 
Son Goku. Despite the references to Dragon Ball, the series itself is not a continuation of the manga series and the various references are not intended to be 
canonical. Although the connection is tenuous, several references to Neko Majin Z were added as 
Easter eggs to the 
Japanese version of the 
video game  (notably in the form of Kuriza as an alternate outfit for Freeza, complete with a chestnut-shaped Death Ball attack), and Z makes an appearance as a secret support character in the Japanese version of .




Notable characters





Neko Majin


 Neko majin  literally means  Cat Genie  in Japanese (The word  majin  is difficult to translate. Its meaning is more precisely conveyed as  magical demon ). Neko Majin Z is described as the strongest neko majin in existence. Like other 
Dragon Ball Z characters, he can fly and use  Nekohameha  (similar to Kamehameha, except for cats). He is revealed to be a disciple of 
Goku in the last chapter of the series. It is unclear how he makes a living, though he attempts to trick tourists into believing he is a Koala bear, charging $8 for a picture. Z has a 





Super Saiyan




-like transformation called Super Neko Majin.







Onio


A comic character poking fun at the previous image of Saiyans as cool, good-looking people. Onio lands on Earth for his honeymoon, and decides to kill the human race to make Earth his country house (or country planet?). He bears much resemblance to Suppaman (Kuraaku Kenta) from one of Toriyama's previous manga, 















Dr. Slump














. Onio is enraged, becoming a Super Saiyan when Neko Majin Z touches his wife's breasts, but quickly loses in a fight scene.







Kuriza


The son of Dragon Ball Z villain, 
Freeza, Kuriza is the exact replica of his father except that his head is in the shape of a chestnut and can even go into a final form like his father. Kuriza is called by Onio to destroy Neko Majin Z, but ends up playing a game of football with him instead. He frequently mentions that Neko Majin is wasting pages with meaningless comments and battle scenes.







Vegeta


The popular character from Dragon Ball Z is called to Earth by Kuriza and Onio, who need help defeating Neko Majin Z. Vegeta discovers that Neko Majin Z is surprisingly strong, and pretends to receive a call from his home planet to avoid an embarrassing defeat. He remarks that he will never agree to be in a gag manga ever again as he leaves.







Majin Boo


Boo makes a short appearance to help when Neko Majin Z is rendered helpless by Usamajin (the lesser-known rabbit version of Neko Majin) Every time Neko Majin wasn't in the scene Boo would come out making people think he was Neko Majin. Neko Majin's design and abilities are obviously a copy of Majin Boo.







Goku


The main character of Dragon Ball makes an appearance in the last chapter of Neko Majin where he fights and defeats Neko Majin Z. He then tells Neko Majin there is a new evil that he needs help defeating near the Son Family home. When they get there, the enemy is just a mouse in the food pantry of Goku's home.






English-language release



Fan translations of the Neko Majin series have been available for some time online. In the October 2007 issue of the American version of 
Shonen Jump, Viz included a translation of Neko Majin Z issue 5.




Italian-language release



In February 2007 the Italian publisher 
Star Comics released the Complete Edition (Kanzenban) containing all 8 chapters, using a green background cover instead of the original yellow.

Roman Candle was 


Elliott Smith

's debut album as a solo artist, even though he was still a singer and guitarist for the band 


Heatmiser

.  The album has a raw, homemade sound (see 
Lo-fi), with Smith playing each instrument and recording it on his 
four-track recorder.  Kid Tulsa (






Pete Krebs





) played snare and cymbal on tracks  No Name #1  and  Kiwi Maddog 20/20 .  According to the Elliott Smith biography, Elliott Smith and the Big Nothing, Elliott recorded the album in the basement of the home of then-girlfriend and Heatmiser manager J.J. Gonson.  The album was never intended for release, as Smith only expected to get a deal for a seven-inch record, however, after Gonson played the album for Cavity Search Records, they immediately requested permission to release it in its entirety.  Smith at first hesitated, and then allowed permission.

Japanese musical instruments
Necked lutes
Drumhead lutes







The sanshin (, literally meaning  Three strings ) is an 
Okinawan 
musical instrument, and precursor of the Japanese 
shamisen. Often likened to a 
banjo, it consists of a snakeskin-covered body, neck and three strings.

Its close resemblance in both appearance and name to the Chinese 
sanxian suggests its Chinese origins, the old 
Ry ky  Kingdom (pre-Japanese Okinawa) having very close ties with China. In the 

16th century
, the sanshin reached the Japanese trading port at 








Sakai







 in 
Osaka, 
Japan. In mainland Japan, it evolved into the larger 
shamisen.


The Okinawan names for the strings are (from thick to thin) uujiru (,  male string ), nakajiru (,  middle string ), and miijiru (,  female string ). The strings are white, except in 
Amami, where they are yellow.


Traditionally, players wore a 
plectrum, made of a material such as the 
horn of the 
water buffalo, on the index 
finger. Many still do, whereas others use a 
guitar pick or the 
nail of the index finger. In Amami, long, narrow 
plectra of 
bamboo are also in use.


In mainland Japan, many people refer to the sanshin as jabisen (, literally  
snake-skin strings ) or jamisen (,  
snake three strings ) because the body of the instrument has a snakeskin covering. A bamboo 
bridge raises the strings off the skin.


In the years following 







World War II






, many Okinawans made sanshin from empty 
tin cans. These  kankara sanshin  were a sign of both the poverty of the postwar years, and the Okinawans' tenacious love of music.


Due to international wildlife protection treaties, it is not legal to export snakeskin-covered sanshins to some countries (for example the United Kingdom and United States). If buying a sanshin to take out of Okinawa, it is probably advisable to purchase one that is not covered with snakeskin.


Since non-snakeskin-covered sanshins tend to be cheaper and less well-made, there are two options for individuals wanting to buy a high quality sanshin for export. The first is to purchase a snakeskin sanshin and have the snakeskin replaced with (usually snakeskin-patterned) cloth. Most sanshin workshops will do this. However, anyone thinking of doing this should be advised that changing the material can radically affect the sound of the sanshin, so there is no guaranteeing that the instrument's tonal qualities will be preserved. Perhaps a better option is to have a non-snakeskin sanshin custom-made. In many cases, this should not cost significantly more than buying a snakeskin sanshin and having it re-bound, and the risk of disappointment is lower.

Violet Trefusis nee Keppel (
June 6, 
1894   
March 1 
1972) was an 

English
 
writer and 
socialite. She is most notable from her 
lesbian affair with 



Vita Sackville-West


, which was featured under disguise in 



Virginia Woolf


's .


Early life


Violet Trefusis was the daughter of 
courtesan 












Alice Keppel











, a mistress of King 


Edward VII of the United Kingdom

. Although she bore this surname until she married, she was said to be the daughter of 

William Beckett
, a banker and MP for 










Whitby









1, but her mother had taken several lovers during that time, and there are several possibilities. Throughout her childhood Trefusis was witness to her mother's numerous lovers, all prominent powerful men of the day.2


Trefusis lived her early youth in 

London
, where the Keppel family had a house in 
Portman Square. When Trefusis was four years old, Alice Keppel became one of the favorite mistresses of Albert Edward (Bertie), the Prince of Wales, who became 


King Edward VII

 on 
January 22, 
1901. He paid visits to the Keppel household in the afternoon around 
tea-time (while her husband, who was aware of the affair, was conveniently absent), on a regular basis till the end of his life in 1910. Discretion was a hallmark of Alice Keppel.2


In 1900 Violet's sister, 












Sonia











, was born.




Her affair with Vita Sackville-West


Trefusis is best remembered today for her love affair with the wealthy 



Vita Sackville-West


, having figured in 



Virginia Woolf


's novel .  In this romanticized biography of Vita, Trefusis appears in it as the Slavic princess Sasha.32


This was not the only account of this love affair, which appears in reality to have been very much more strenuous than Woolf's enchanting account: both in fiction (Challenge by Sackville-West and Trefusis, Broderie Anglaise a 
roman a clef in French by Trefusis) and in non-fiction (






Portrait of a Marriage





 by Sackville-West with extensive  clarifications  added by her son 

Nigel Nicolson
) further parts of the story appeared in print.  


There are still the surviving letters and diaries written by the partakers in the plot. Apart from those of the two central players, there are records from 












Alice Keppel











, Victoria Sackville-West, 



















Harold Nicolson


















, 
Denys Trefusis and Pat Dansey.2


Probably the most conclusive overview of the whole story can be found in 
Diana Souhami's Mrs Keppel and her Daughter.2 In headlines:



 When she was 10, Violet met Vita (who was two years older) for the first time. After that they went to the same school for several years, and soon recognised bond between them. When Violet was 14, she confessed Vita her love, and gave her a ring. 


 In 1910, after the death of Edward VII, Mrs Keppel made her family observe a  discretion  leave of about two years, before re-establishing themselves in British society: upon returning the Keppels moved to another address (
Grosvenor Street).


 By the time Violet returned to London, Vita was soon to be engaged to Harold Nicolson, and frequented her love atffair with 
Rosamund Grosvenor. Violet made clear that she still loved Vita, and got engaged herself to make Vita jealous. But all Violet wanted was to get rid of hypocrisy, especially the hypocrisy of marriage (and all that went with it in those days). This didn't stop Vita from marrying Harold (October 1913), who, in his turn, didn't stop his 
homosexual adventures for marriage.


 April 1918 Violet and Vita refreshed and intensified their bond. Vita had two sons by now, but these were left in the care of others when Vita and Violet left for a holiday in 

Cornwall
. Meanwhile Mrs Keppel was busy arranging a marriage for Violet with Denys Trefusis. A few days after the 
armistice Sackville-West and Trefusis went away to 

France
 for several months. Because of Vita's exclusivity claim, and her own loathing of marriage, Trefusis made Denys promise never to have sex with her, as a condition for marriage. So, in June 1919 they married. The end of that year Trefusis and Sackville-West made a new two-month excursion to 

France
: ordered to do so by his mother in law, Denys got Trefusis back from the south of 

France
 when new gossip about Sackville-West's and Trefusis's loose behaviour began to reach 

London
.


 The next time they left, in February 1920, was to be the final elopement. Sackville-West might still have some doubts, and probably hoped that Harold would interfere. Harold did arrive with Denys in a two-seater airplane, which led to heated scenes in 





Amiens




. The climax came when Harold told Sackville-West that Trefusis had been unfaithful to her (with Denys). Trefusis tried to explain and assured her innocence (which was true in all likelihood). Sackville-West was much too upset and in rage to listen and fled, saying she couldn't bear too see her at least for two months. It was after six weeks when Sackville-West finally came back to France to meet Trefusis.  


 Mrs Keppel desperately tried to keep scandal away from London, where Trefusis's sister, Sonia, was about to be married (paving her way to become, together with 
Roland Cubitt, a grandparent to 
Camilla Parker Bowles. That meant Trefusis spent much of her time in 1920 abroad, clinging desperately to Sackville-West via continuous letters. 


 In January 1921 Sackville-West and Trefusis made a final journey to 

France
, where they spent six weeks together. At this time Harold threatened to break off the marriage if Sackville-West still continued her escapes. When Sackville-West returned to 

England
 in March, it was practically the end of the affair. Trefusis was sent to 



Italy


, and from there she wrote her last desperate letters to their mutual friend Pat Dansey; she was forbidden to write directly to Sackville-West. At the end of the year Trefusis had to face the facts, and start to build her life from the scratch.    




A few years, and some postludes, later it becomes increasingly clear that Trefusis's fantasy of 
romantic love lived to the fullest in an accepting social context were not to come true. The more traditional concept of an upfront marriage with hidden extramarital adventures to complete it - as it had been lived by Mrs Keppel, and would continue to be lived by Sackville-West and Harold - proved immensely stronger for many years to come. 


An essential difference between Mrs Keppel and Sackville-West seems to be that Mrs Keppel made a trade of never distressing her lovers (and their marriages), thus advancing her family socially and financially, while Sackville-West caused broken hearts more than once: for her marriage was rather the refuge she could always come back to after periods of abandonment.


As a side-note it might appear not so surprising that, notwithstanding some general changes in social context by that time, the inherent unresolved tensions of all three models (Trefusis's, Mrs Keppel's and Sackville-West's) - including mothers taking sides in view of a socially acceptable solution - reappeared in the 


Diana

 - 


Camilla

 - 


Charles

 triangle - surely not so exceptional in this respect.


The two former lovers met again in 1940 after the war had forced Trefusis to come back to 

England
. They continued to keep in touch and send each other affectionate letters.



Further Reading About the Affair


There have been extensive writings on the affair, many reflecting what is believed to have been the mistreatment of Trefusis by Sackville-West. Most reflect that Trefusis was completely engulfed and overwhelmed by the affair, as was Sackville-West, but that it was Sackville-West who was ultimately in control.  Jullian Phillipe wrote Violet Trefusis: A Biography, Including Correspondence with Vita Sackville-West, which was released in paperback in 1985. Other writings on the affair include the Jullian Phillipe and John Phillips book, The Other Woman, A Life of Violet Trefusis, and Mrs. Keppel and Her Daughter by Diana Souhami.

Later life


From 1923 on Trefusis became one of the many lovers of the 






Singer





 sewing machine heiress 









Winnaretta Singer








, daughter of 

Isaac Singer
 and wife of the homosexual 










Prince Edmond de Polignac









, who introduced her to the artistic beau-monde in 

Paris
. Trefusis conceding more and more to her mother's model of being  socially acceptable , but at the same time not wavering on her sexuality. 


Singer, as Sackville-West had, dominated the relationship, though apparently to mutual satisfaction. The two were together for many years, and seemed to have had a healthy and happy relationship. Trefusis's mother, Alice Keppel, did not object to this affair, most likely due to the wealth and power of Singer, and the fact that Singer carried on the affair in a much more disciplined way. Trefusis seemed to prefer the role of submissive, and therefore fit with Singer well, as she was typically dominant and in control in her relationships. Neither were completely faithful during their long affair, but unlike her affair with Sackville-West, this seemed to have had no negative effect on their relationship. 


In 1924 Mrs Keppel bought L'Ombrellino, a large villa overlooking 

Florence
, where once 


Galileo Galilei

 had lived. Eventually, after her parents' death in 1947, Trefusis would become the 
chatelaine of L'Ombrellino, till the end of her life.


In 1929, Denys Trefusis died, completely estranged from his seemingly unfeeling wife. After his death, Violet published several novels, some in English, some in French, that she had written in her medieval  Tour  in Saint-Loup-de-Naud, 

Seine-et-Marne
, 

France
 - a gift from Winnaretta.


During 







the Second World War






, in London, Violet participated in the broadcastings of (
http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_libre) La France Libre, which earned her a 
Legion d'Honneur after the war.






Nancy Mitford


 said that Violet's autobiography should be titled Here Lies Violet Trefusis, and partly based the character of  Lady Montdore  in 





Love in a Cold Climate




 on her.

Down at the Old Bull and Bush which closed the show. The show was compered by 


Leonard Sachs

 who introduced the acts. In the course of its run it featured about 2000 artists.



History


The show was first broadcast on

Richard Stuart Linklater (born

Academy Award
-nominated 








American







 
film director and 
screenwriter.



Biography



Early life


Linklater was born in 

Houston
, 


Texas

. He studied at 

Sam Houston State University
 and left midway through his stint in college to work on an off-shore 
oil rig in the 


Gulf of Mexico

. While working on the rig he read a lot of literature, but on land he developed a love of film through repeated visits to a repertory theater in Houston. It was at this point that Linklater realized he wanted to be a filmmaker. After his job on the oil rig, Linklater used the money he had saved to buy a 



Super-8


 camera, a projector, and some editing equipment, and moved to 

Austin
. It was there that the aspiring cineaste founded the 
Austin Film Society and grew to appreciate such stylized 
auteurs like 


Robert Bresson

, 
Yasujiro Ozu, 





Rainer Werner Fassbinder




, 
Nagisa Oshima, and 
Josef Von Sternberg.




Career


Linklater founded the 
Austin Film Society in 1985 together with his frequent collaborator 

Lee Daniel
, and is lauded for launching and solidifying the city of Austin as a hub for independent filmmaking.


For several years, Linklater made many short films that were, more than anything, exercises and experiments in film techniques. He finally completed his first feature, the rarely seen 








It's Impossible to Learn to Plow by Reading Books







 (which is now available in the Criterion Collection edition of 

Slacker
), a Super-8 feature that took a year to shoot and another year to edit. The film is significant in the sense that it establishes most of Linklater's preoccupations. The film has his trademark style of minimal camera movements and lack of narrative, while it examines the theme of traveling with no real particular direction in mind. These idiosyncrasies would be explored in greater detail in future projects.


To this end Linklater created Detour Filmproduction (an homage to the 1945 low budget 
film noir by 



Edgar G. Ulmer


), and subsequently made 

Slacker
 for only $23,000. The film is an aimless day in the life of the city of Austin, Texas showcasing its more eccentric characters.


While gaining a cult following for his 
independent films, such as 
Dazed and Confused, 

Waking Life
 and 

A Scanner Darkly
, his mainstream comedies, 

School of Rock
 and the remake of 

Bad News Bears
, have gained him wider recognition. In 2003, he wrote and directed a pilot for 
HBO with 




Rodney Rothman



 called 
$5.15/hr, about several 
minimum wage restaurant workers. The pilot deals with themes later examined in 

Fast Food Nation
. In 2004, the British television network Channel 4 produced a major documentary about Linklater, in which the filmmaker frankly discussed the personal and philosophical ideas behind his films.  St Richard of Austin  was presented by Ben Lewis and directed by Irshad Ashraf and broadcast on Channel 4 in December 2004 in the UK. In 2005, Linklater was nominated for an 
Academy Award for 
Best Adapted Screenplay for his film 

Before Sunset
.


Many of Linklater's films take place in one day, a technique that has gained popularity in recent years. 

Slacker
, 
Dazed and Confused, 

Tape
, 

Before Sunrise
, and 

Before Sunset
 are examples of this method. Two of his recent films (

A Scanner Darkly
 and 

Waking Life
) both display a similar animated style. To create this effect, Linklater shot and edited both movies into a completed live-action state, then employed a team of artists to 'trace over' individual frames (a technique known as 
rotoscoping). The result is a distinctive 'semi-real' quality, praised by such critics as 



Roger Ebert


 (in the case of 

Waking Life
) as being original and well-suited to the aims of the film.


His latest film, 

Fast Food Nation
, is an adaptation of the best selling book that examines the local and global influence of the United States fast food industry. The film was released in North America on 17th November 2006 and in Europe on 23rd March 2007.


Despite his popularity and ability to direct high paying Hollywood productions, Linklater remains in Texas and refuses to live or work in Hollywood for any extended period of time.

Alan Bleasdale (born 23 March 1946 in 

Liverpool
, 

Merseyside
, 

England
, brought up in 

Huyton
) is an 

English
 
television dramatist, best known for several 
social realist drama serials based on the lives of ordinary people.



Early life


Bleasdale is an only child, his father worked in a food factory and his mother in a grocery shop. From 1951-57, he went to the 
St. Aloysius Roman Catholic infant and junior Schools on Twig Lane in Huyton-with-Roby (then in Lancashire). From 1957-64, he went to Wade Deacon Grammar School on Birchfield Road in 

Widnes
 (now the 
Wade Deacon High School since 1974). In 1967, he obtained a teaching certificate from the Padgate College of Education (which became 
Warrington Collegiate Institute, now part of the 

University of Chester
) on Winwick Road near 

Warrington
. In 1967, he married Julia Moses and they now have two sons and one daughter. For eight years he worked as a teacher at St Columba's Secondary Modern School (now St Columba's Catholic Primary School) on Hillside Road in Huyton from 1967-71, then King George V School (now The King George V   Elaine Bernacchi School and based in 
Bikenibeu in 









South Tarawa








) on the 
Gilbert and Ellice Islands (now called 

Kiribati
 since 1979) in the 
Pacific Ocean from 1971-4, and lastly at Halewood Grange Comprehensive School (now known as 
Halewood College) on The Avenue in 

Halewood
 from 1974-5. From 1975 to 1986 he worked as a playwright at the 

Liverpool Playhouse
 (becoming associate director) and the 




Contact Theatre



 in Manchester (owned by the 

University of Manchester
).




Broadcasting


His first success came as a writer of 
radio drama for the 

BBC
, with several plays following the character of 

Scully
 being broadcast on his local station, 

BBC Radio Merseyside
, in 1971. Scully was a young man from Liverpool, and Bleasdale's plays represented a more realistic, contemporary depiction of life there than was usually seen in the media.


The character became so successful that Bleasdale wrote a stage play, two novels and in 1978 a 





BBC Television




 play about the character. The same year, he wrote another one-off play for 

BBC One
, entitled The Black Stuff. This latter play concerned the story of a group of Liverpudlian tarmac-layers - the 'black stuff' of the title - and a job in 

Middlesbrough
 that goes disastrously wrong for all of them resulting in the loss of their jobs.


Although the play remained untransmitted for two years as it waited for an available slot, on its eventual broadcast in 1980 it won much praise, and producer 






Michael Wearing





 of BBC English Regions Drama managed to commission the sequel serial that Bleasdale had already been working on. The series, 

Boys from the Blackstuff
, was transmitted on 

BBC Two
 in 1982. It established Bleasdale as one of Britain's most important television writers and social commentators. 
http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/B/htmlB/bleasdaleal/bleasdaleal.htm 


Bleasdale penned the script for the 1985 film No Surrender, a black comedy in which a group of elderly Protestant hardliners are booked into a party at a pub on the same night as a group of equally sectarian Catholic old-timers.


Since Boys from the Blackstuff, Bleasdale has gone on to pen several other award winning television dramas, including 




The Monocled Mutineer



 (1986, 

BBC One
) and 
G.B.H. (1991, 

Channel 4
). In 1999 Bleasdale adapted 





Oliver Twist




 for ITV. The adaptation was well received but attracted some controversy as Bleasdale expanded the narrative adding a backstory.


In 1987, 



Charlottetown Festival


 director 



Walter Learning


 presented the Canadian premiere of the Bleasdale musical Are You Lonesome Tonight? at the 







Confederation Centre of the Arts






, a national arts centre located on 

Prince Edward Island
. A storm of controversy erupted across the country with opponents decrying the presentation of the tough look at the life of 




Elvis Presley



 at the festival, which had been known for lightweight family fare such as 

Anne of Green Gables - The Musical
. The chairman of the Board of Directors resigned in protest over the Bleasdale play and objections to the rough language and subject matter were even brought up in the provincial legislature. However, the play was allowed to proceed and became a major critical and financial success for the festival that season.

Zebra Girl


2000-05-068




Zebra Girl is a 
webcomic by 
Joe England, concerning the adventures of a young woman who (because of a magical accident) is transformed into a 
demon. It debuted on 
May 6, 
2000. It won the 
2004 Web Cartoonist's Choice Award for Black and White Art and has been nominated for 
Outstanding Story Concept in 2005 and 
Outstanding Black and White Art again in 2007. The comic is currently hosted in 




Keenspot



.

The story centers on Sandra, a girl with a 
cynical streak who lives with her naive best friend Crystal and Crystal's lecherous brother Jack. Due to a mishap involving Jack and an ancient tome of magic, Sandra is transformed into a demon.12 The title refers to Sandra's demonic features, which include black-and-white stripes and 
hooves. Less 
zebra-like features include 
purple hair, 
horns, a 
third eye in the forehead, 
clawed four-fingered hands, retractable 
wings, acidic blood and body fluids, a devil-like 
tail and the ability to cause people (usually Jack) to 
spontaneously combust. She has also recently demonstrated the ability to manipulate human minds to some degree, mostly through 
hallucinations. While originally started out as a humour comic, the story later takes a more serious turn. The main comic is accompanied by a second comic, Sandra's Journal!, drawn by Sandra, describing her everyday life and her feelings about her demonic condition.


England changed the layout of the strip on 
2007-04-083 to one similar to a 
comic book to make printing the strips easier. England said that he was inspired to do this by 
Tracy Butler (
Lackadaisy), 
Remy Mokhtar (
Marry Me) and 
Bleedman (
Sugar Bits).



Characters



Major characters



Sandra


A young sensible college graduate transformed suddenly into a demon. She's coping stoically, but she's not happy. Her greatest fear is losing her soul to her demonic side, though she has found ways to hold on to her soul - mostly by hanging with Crystal and by setting Jack on fire.


Sandra has experienced many changes since being turned into a demon; she has discovered that she can grow wings, that Hell is very interested in swallowing her up, and that all her bodily fluids have been turned into a corrosive acid - something that makes it impossible for her to taste anything besides coffee. 


She has started her own tech support business so that she can have a job while staying indoors. There is a mock-up 
Zebragirl Tech Support page within the website, which emphasizes that while  face-to-face consultation is not available , her customers receive answers from  a real human being.  She also advises her potential customers to remain calm and patient,  lest they suffer from something strange and violent  - Sandra has been known to set on fire callers with less than stellar technical knowledge.


Her outdoor excursions are aided by a hooded coat, made by Crystal, that makes her look like a bizarre loner goth type. She explains the  makeup  as being there to cover up scars from an obscenely complicated accident involving oily rags, a rickety ladder, a low flying bird and a room full of 
knives - surprisingly, nobody has yet disbelieved this far-fetched explanation.


While Sandra was initially most terrified of losing her soul to her demonic side, she has experienced many feelings- joy and elation at realizing she was not a monster like Tool, acceptance of her demonic form, fear of her nightmares- and eventually reached the point where she has fully embraced her demonic side. She is now terrorizing the town she lives in, a monster in the shadows, and is desperate to make Sam hate her- mostly so that she can remove the  last thing  keeping her human.




Jack


Housemate of Sandra. Young, brash, self-proclaimed 
slacker and 
pervert (emphasized by his permanent  PERV  t-shirt), Jack undergoes a great deal of character development in the comic.


Initially haunted by his guilt at causing Sandra's transformation, he began studying magic in order to fix her, becoming bound with his spellbook, whose name- ironically- is Tomie.


While initially it gave him only light magical powers, an incident occurred in which Sandra and Crystal were dragged to another dimension (this being Sam's cartoon world). Left behind, Jack began intensive meditation and research, eventually finding a place called the 'Net, a place where other mages could communicate with each other telepathically.


While there, Jack joined the crusade that would eventually determine much of his future life: to get magic back into the world again. While on the 'Net, he personally introduced two children to magic.


Unfortunately, the 'Net was a trap; an evil wizard had created it long ago so that, when new wizards showed up and magic returned, he could absorb their souls and become much more powerful. His plan worked, to an extent, but missed Jack's soul. Jack fought against the wizard's demons, and won because of his high resistance to fire (developed from living with Sandra), but then died, and was sent back, like 


Gandalf

 from 
Lord of the Rings. His ascension turned him into a full-fledged 
wizard, known as Jack the 
Plaid, and with his new powers he banished the evil wizard and freed his friend's souls to go on into the afterlife.


This event changed him; he became the most mature and level-headed character in some ways, though still enjoys playing with his powers. He now runs the newly-revived 'Net, and is looked up to as leader by most of the new mages who have found it. He is also continuing the crusade originally started on the 'Net: get people to believe in magic again. He mostly focuses on children, as few others believe him.


He is currently trying to help Sandra reconnect to her human side.


Jack has many powers as a wizard, but his first and most basic power is a result of his living conditions. Sandra's anger at him frequently 
sets him on fire. The frequency with which this happens, as well as his magical abilities, have given his body powerful innate regenerative abilities, so that he is fully healed after a few hours. Moreover, it has given him an exceptionally high tolerance for pain, surprising even demons with his ability to shrug off burns and wounds. 


There was some speculation, inside and outside the comic, that his powers could block Sandra's powers, and he reveals that he could; but that he allows her to burn him as penance and in order to vent her building demonic rage. 


He possesses multiple spellcasting powers, from crossing dimensions to hurling spells; he also has a powerful connection to things that are 
plaid, as it is his symbol and his totem. He can control objects the color of his totem and even best opponents much stronger than him if they are wearing plaid. He leaves a plaid trail after himself when he flies, or is in a trance, as a further indicator of his powers.




Crystal


Sandra's other housemate. Jack's twin sister. Cheerful and pleasant, despite being a 
telemarketer. She seems to have subtle 
clairvoyant powers; her offhand comments often 
foreshadow future 
story arcs. She can also read 
Sumerian (so far only really used in the setup of the story). Her boyfriend is Wally. She has recently taken an affection to the 
goth lifestyle, though her attempts to appear moody are frequently defeated by attacks of cuteness triggered by 
puppies and such.4 She is also trying to reverse her sleep cycle to live by night  because it's a gothy thing to do , but so far her body has manifested a will of its own to stick with sleeping at night. She has learned a handful of magic spells, mostly mind-reading and minor mind altering tricks. In her own words,  go for the 


Jedi

 stuff first. 5




Sam


An embittered 
cartoon 
rabbit existing both as a 
fictional character in an old TV show, and as a real person that Sandra, Jack and Crystal meet in another 


dimension

 (ruled by Tool). Afterwards, having saved Sandra from other demons, Sam becomes stranded in Sandra's world. 


He is Sandra, actually, but in another dimension; he shares her soul, and her memories, particularly the near-death experience she had of her life flashing before her eyes (described as  someone else's life can flash before your eyes, too. ) 


Because of his 
lagomorphic attributes (i.e. freakishly large ears) and his unusual nature as an extradimensional being, he has proven to be remarkably sensitive to supernatural disturbances, even faint traces of other demons or occult beings. After working in television for so long, he has a habit of relating events going on around him to 
cliche plot devices, as well as predicting bad dialog. 


Perhaps the most remarkable thing about Sam is the fact that he goes out of the house at times sans any sort of disguise. He believes that no one will take him at face value, believing him to be a hallucination, a man in a costume, or whatever other explanation they can conjure. So far, he has been shown to be completely correct.




Tomie


The 
sentient book of magic that caused Sandra's transformation and that Jack studies in his search to restore her. Rather to its own surprise it has become a friend of Jack. Only Jack can hear Tomie speak and the others seem unsure whether the book is really alive or if it's Jack's imagination. Seems to share Jack's 
pervert aspect and has manifested many times his desire to be near his secret stash of erotic magazines. 


While he is a compendium of highly advanced magical knowledge, he has only fleeting awareness of his own contents through what previous owners have told him his chapters describe. This is because he is unable to read his own pages, as Tomie puts it to Jack:  Can you read your own intestines? 


Because he is now bound to Jack, events will always conspire to bring them back together should they become separated somehow.




Wally


Crystal's new 
werewolf boyfriend. Once the lowest member of Doyenne's pack, he is now trying to be human but often absent-mindedly falls back into old patterns (such as sleeping on the floor). He likes to sing 



Louis Armstrong


 and Crystal was first attracted to his voice. His eyes are two different colors, and those colors switch around when he turns into his wolf form.




Mr. Chalk


A mysterious figure appearing only in dreams thus far. He appears a sort of 
silhouette, with only the white outlines of his mouth visible (reminiscent of 








Apocalypse







's mouth). He first appeared in Sandra's dreams shortly after her return from Tool's dimension. His conversations with Sandra have upset her, leaving her quite concerned. At times it seems that it is his goal to make her upset - angry, or fearful in particular. Mr. Chalk has recently made brief appearances in the dreams of others.





Other characters





Mike   A normal adult man, which one has to admit is becoming exceedingly rare in this comic. He was interested in Sandra early on, eagerly curious to figure out the secret of the 'strange 
goth girl' he often saw at the 
bookstore and 
coffee shop. He discovered her demonic condition, deeply hurting her feelings in the process, though he did not reveal this to his other curious friends. He has been haunted by guilt ever since, and he has attempted many times to contact her in order to make up for the pain he caused. He appears to be genuinely attracted to her now, but he knows that her current condition makes a relationship impossible - a single kiss would dissolve his entire face, as he experienced in a very vivid nightmare (apparently caused by Mr Chalk).6


Jen   A college student who pursued the 
occult all her life in the attempt to 
document it, but failed repeatedly until a chance encounter with Sandra. Because of a recent wound by Doyenne, Sandra required organic material from a human being to heal, and Jen was able to provide it for her with the help of Jack to heal the damage inflicted by this strange feeding process. Jen has since vanished from the mainstream media, taking her now mildly enchanted camera to interview magical beings and monsters who live in the shadows and dark cracks of the so-called ordinary world.


Tool   Uncontested soulless cyborg ruler of the 


parallel universe

 from which Sam hails, where most inhabitants are 
furry 
anthropomorphs. He is visually represented as a 
quadrupedal 
arachnoid mechanism with a human torso affixed to the top of its cephalothorax. His appearance as a whole is suggestive of 
driders and 








Mojo







, while his visage is suggestive of 



















Lobo


















 and 


Count Olaf

. His lack of a soul somehow made him invisible to Sandra, her third eye altering her sense of sight so that she saw people's souls rather than their physical bodies. He drifted to an unidentified hell dimension7 as Jack pulled back Sam, Sandra and Crystal back to earth with him.


Jacob - Tool's mechanical companion, highly advanced and autonomous (possibly self-aware) which Tool built as an artificial soul replacement of sorts and meant to be his conscience. Has frequently been the target of Tool's violent outbursts of rage, and has shown himself equally capable of dealing violence and torture to others. He is responsible for Crystal's ever-present link earrings, which were really chains used to hold her head tied to a torture device and have now become permanently fused in place.


Doyenne   
Alpha female of a werewolf pack, she is Wally's former leader. She has taken an interest in Sandra and her friends, though her reasons for doing so are nebulous at best. She has gone into hiding after being defeated in combat.


Professor Broadshoulders   A professional demonologist who hunts all demons to exorcise or destroy them. While he has been unrelenting in hunting Sandra, he is not doing so out of malice but rather out of fierce determination to drive demons out of earth forever. His extreme focus comes from the scar he received from a demon   a 'yucky face' brand burned into his forehead, usually hidden under his hat. Was responsible for sending Sandra and Crystal to Tool's dimension where they met Sam. He has now been turned into a demon himself, apparently as the result of the same curse which placed a 'yucky face' permanently on his forehead. He was then sent to a Hell dimension by Sandra. It's been recently revealed that this mark had some sort of significant role to play, as it opened up and revealed a third eye similar to Sandra's before being thrust into Hell, is the sign of his damnation for summoning something too strong for him to control during his college years, and never actually damned him; it was just a motive for him to damn himself. He revealed to Sam that he intended Sandra to be his last kill, and that destroying her would be a suicide mission. 


Harold DuVase   At first, Harold appeared to be a harmless 


Harry Potter

 look-alike, but was soon revealed as a powerful and ancient wizard who created a magical 
pocket reality called Magi-Net. He invited all wizards and mages of the world to gather there as a sort of social club, but this turned out to be a trap to drain their essence and steal their powers. Jack barely escaped the trap with his life, and 'died' during his battle with Harold, 'pulling a 


Gandalf

' to be reborn as Jack the Plaid. Jack defeated Harold and freed the souls of his friends, though he could not restore their lives. Harold is now cursed by Jack, condemned to always be in the one place in the universe where he least wants to be. Should he ever think of a place he'd want to be even less, he would be relocated there instantly. Of course, it is inevitable that he'll show up at Jack's doorstep one day because of this, although he'll probably blink away before he can do anything.


Sandra's Mom - Like all mothers do, she cares very much for her daughter. We get a sense of her personality through hearing Sandra's side of phone conversations with her. She senses from her voice on the phone that something is terribly wrong and hopes that Sandra will confide what that problem is. She has only been seen directly through Sandra's imagination, trying to predict what her reaction would be to finding out that her child has turned into a demon. We also know from Sandra's Journal that her mom always looks a little worried, even when she's smiling, and that she has a penchant for 
digital cameras and other electronic gizmos.


Mary Shrieks and Pooka Zin - A strange robed woman and a demonic  rarebit  bearing a strange friendship of sorts, similar to Sandra and Sam's. Mary Shrieks' nearly featureless robe looks like a streamlined version of Sandra's own, and Pooka Zin is similar to Sam, albeit as tall as Mary Shrieks, with a gaping, wolfish mouth with a row of very long and sharp fangs, and long, clawed fingers. Pooka Zin dresses in sharp Victorian fashion, and he and Mary are briefly seen discussing Sandra, Sam and the series of mishaps happening around Miscellaneous. Zin in particular quotes Goya's  the dream of reason produces monsters .







Sandra's Journal''


Sandra's Journal is a four-panel 
autobiographical webcomic fictionally  drawn  by Sandra, mainly discussing her new life as a demon. The art style is radically different from that of the main Zebra Girl comic. In contrast to the sharp lineart and cross-hatching techniques used in Zebra Girl, Sandra's Journal appears like very rough sketchwork. This is explained by Sandra's inability to use a pen properly due to her claws. It is explained that she  draws  the comic by dipping her fingers in ink and using them as a sort of 
quill. 


The events of Sandra's Journal are generally Sandra's own musings and fantasies; thus, they are fictitious within the context of the main comic. Generally, the Journal strips are disconnected from the main comic. However, on occasion, they reflect Sandra's thoughts and reactions to events from the current storyline. This was especially evident in the most recent (as of January 2007) storyline, where a character named Stubby appeared. It eventually became evident that Stubby was at least partially a projection of Sandra.


At the current moment, her strips depictions are disjointed and 
schizophrenic, reflecting her demonic mindframe and possibly the struggle of her human side trying to reassert itself.

As with many webcomics, the fans have created a fair body of work in tribute to the characters and the world. Outside of the graphic art, there have been several multimedia projects including two songs, four 
music videos using images from the comic, and a short 
live-action 
fan film (
currently hosted on 

YouTube
).
There is also a short 
fan mini-comic on the Zebra Girl website's forums, set in the same milieu, by one Pnelma Tirian.

Plastic welding
Welding





Plastic welding is the process of 
welding 
plastic parts together. There are several techniques:



Hot gas welding


This is a plastic welding technique which is analogous to 
gas welding of metals, though the specific techniques are different.  A specially designed heat gun (hot air welder) produces a jet of hot air that softens the parts to be joined, as well as a plastic filler rod. 
Hot air/gas welding is a common fabrication technique for manufacturing smaller items such as chemical tanks, water tanks (black, grey, fresh   ballast), heat exchangers, and plumbing fittings. The materials being welded and the welding rod must be of the same or very similar plastic. Welding PVC to acrylic is an exception to this rule. -
Seelye, Inc.and 
Wegenerwelding LLC, is one of the leading manufacturers of hot air/gas thermoplastic welders.
Other manufacturers include 
KAMWELD, 
Malcom, Inc., Leister, STAMMECH, 
Lou Zampini   Associates. Projects made from poly family plastics end up being cabinets, medical facility chases, transport assemblies




Free hand welding


With free hand welding, the jet of hot air from the welder is played on the weld area and the tip of the weld rod at the same time. As the rod softens, it is pushed into the joint and fuses to the parts. Free hand welding is a difficult technique to master, and is slow. However, welds can be made in almost any situation.




Speed tip welding


With speed welding, the plastic welder, similar to a soldering iron in appearance and wattage, is fitted with a feed tube for the plastic weld rod. The speed tip heats the rod and the substrate, while at the same time it presses the molten weld rod into position. A bead of softened plastic is laid into the joint, and the parts and weld rod fuse. With some types of plastic such as polypropylene, the melted welding rod must be  mixed  with the semi-melted base material being fabricated or repaired. These welding techniques have been perfected over time and have been utilised for over 50 years by professional plastic fabricators and repairers internationally. Speed tip welding method is a much faster welding technique and with practice can be used in tight corners.




 Plastic welding rod 


This is the extruded rod that is used to weld plastic. Suitable rod materials include ABS, PVC, Polypropylene, polyethylene, and many other types of thermoplastic. 
Plastic welding rod is available in a wide range of colors to match a project's color.




Extrusion welding


Extrusion welding allows the application of bigger welds in a single weld pass. It is the preferred technique for joining material over 6 mm thick. Welding rod is drawn into a miniature hand held plastic extruder, plasticized, and forced out of the extruder against the parts being joined, which are softened with a jet of hot air to allow bonding to take place.




Contact welding


This is the same as 
spot welding except that heat is supplied with convection of the pincher tips instead of electrical conduction. Two plastic parts are brought together where heated tips pinch them, melting and joining the parts in the process.




Hot plate welding


Related to contact welding, this technique is used to weld larger parts, or parts that have a complex weld joint geometry. The two parts to be welded are placed in the tooling attached to the two opposing platens of a press. A hot plate, with a shape that matches the weld joint geometry of the parts to be welded, is moved in position between the two parts. The two opposing platens move the parts into contact with the hot plate until the heat softens the interfaces to the melting point of the plastic. When this condition is achieved the hot plate is removed, and the parts are pressed together and held until the weld joint cools and re solidifies to create a permanent bond.




High frequency welding


Certain plastics with chemical dipoles, such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyamides (PA) and acetates can be heated with high frequency electromagnetic waves. High frequency welding uses this property to soften the plastics for joining. The heating can be localized, and the process can be continuous. Also known as Dielectric Sealing, R.F. (Radio Frequency) Heat Sealing.


This is the same concept as 
induction welding.




Ultrasonic welding


In 
ultrasonic welding, high frequency (15 kHz to 40 kHz ) low amplitude vibration is used to create heat by way of friction between the materials to be joined. The interface of the two parts is specially designed to concentrate the energy for the maximum weld strength.




Vibration or friction welding


In vibration or friction welding, the two parts to be assembled are rubbed together at a lower frequency (typically 100-300 Hz) and higher amplitude (typically 1-2 mm) than 
ultrasonic welding. The friction caused by the 
vibration motion combined with the clamping pressure between the two parts creates the heat which begins to melt the contact areas between the two parts. At this point, the plasticized materials begin to form layers that intertwine with one another, which therefore results in a strong weld. At the completion of the vibration motion, the parts remain held together until the weld joint cools and the melted plastic re-solidifies. The friction movement can be linear or orbital, and the joint design of the two parts has to allow this movement.




Spin welding


Spin welding is another form of frictional welding. With this process, one part is held stationary, while the other one is rotated at high velocity.  The rotating part is then pressed against the fixed part with significant force. This welding process is related to Vibration Welding. 




Laser welding


This technique requires one part to be transmissive to a laser beam and either the other part absorptive or a coating at the interface to be absorptive to the beam. The two parts are put under pressure while the laser beam moves along the joining line. The beam passes through the first part and is absorbed by the other one or the coating to generate enough heat to soften the interface creating a permanent weld.


Semiconductor diode lasers are typically used in plastic welding. Wavelengths in the range of 808nm to 980nm can be used to join various plastic material combinations. Power levels from less than 1W to 100W are needed depending on the materials, thickness and desired process speed. 1 


Diode laser systems have the following advantages in joining of plastic materials:


        Cleaner than adhesive bonding
 	No micro-nozzles to get clogged
 	No liquid or fumes to affect surface finish
 	No consumables 
 	Higher throughput
 	Can access work-piece in challenging geometry
 	High level of process control


Requirements for high strength joints include:


 	Adequate transmission through upper layer
 	Absorption by lower layer
 	Material compatibility   wetting
 	Good joint design   clamping pressure, joint area
 	Lower power density


Materials that can be joined include:


 	Polypropylene
 	Polycarbonate
 	Acrylic
 	Nylon
 	ABS


Specific applications include sealing / welding / joining of: catheter bags, medical containers, automobile remote control keys, heart pacemaker casings, syringe tamper evident joints, headlight or tail-light assemblies, pump housings, and cellular phone parts.




Solvent welding


In solvent welding, a solvent is applied which can temporarily dissolve the polymer at room temperature. When this occurs, the polymer chains are free to move in the liquid and can entangle with other similarly dissolved chains in the other component. Given sufficient time, the solvent will permeate through the polymer and out into the environment, so that the chains lose their mobility. This leaves a solid mass of entangled polymer chains which constitutes a solvent weld.

Environmental degradation is the deterioration of the 
environment through depletion of resources such as 
air, 
water and 
soil; the destruction of 
ecosystems and the extinction of 
wildlife.

Environmental degradation is one of the 
ten threats officially cautioned by the

World Resources Institute (WRI), 
UNEP (the United Nations Environment Programme), 
UNDP (the United Nations Development Programme) and the

 have made public an important report on 
health and the environment worldwide on May 1, 1998.


Environmental degradation is of many types. When natural habitats are destroyed or natural resources are depleted, environment is degraded.


Environmental Change and Human Health, a special section of World Resources 1998-99 in this report describes how preventable 
illnesses and 
premature deaths are still occurring in very large numbers. If vast improvements are made in human health, millions of people will be living longer, healthier lives than ever before. In these poorest regions of the 
world an estimated one in five children will not live to see their fifth birthday, primarily because of environment-related diseases. Eleven million children die worldwide annually, equal to the combined populations of

, and mostly due to 
malaria, 
acute respiratory infections or 
diarrhoea   illnesses that are largely preventable.

Smokeless powder



Smokeless powder is the name given to a number of 
propellants used in 
firearms and 
artillery which produce negligible smoke when fired, unlike the older 
Gunpowder (black powder) which they replaced.

Types of smokeless powder include 
Cordite, 


Ballistite

 and, historically, 


Poudre B

. They are classified as single-base, double-base or triple-base powders.



Description


Smokeless powder consists of 
nitrocellulose (single-base powders), frequently combined with up to 50 percent 
nitroglycerin (double-base powders), and sometimes nitroglycerin and 
nitroguanidine (triple-base), corned into small spherical balls or 
extruded into cylinders or flakes using solvents such as 
ether. Other minor ingredients, such as stabilizers and ballistic modifiers, are also added. Double-base propellants are common in handgun and rifle ammunition. Triple-base propellants are more common in artillery guns.


The reason that they are smokeless is that the 
combustion products are mainly 
gaseous, compared to around 55% solid products for black powder (
potassium carbonate, 
potassium sulfate etc).


Smokeless powder burns only on the surfaces of the granules, flakes or cylinders - described as granules for short. Larger granules burn more slowly, and the burn rate is further controlled by flame-deterrent coatings which retard burning slightly. The intent is to regulate the burn rate so that a more or less constant pressure is exerted on the propelled projectile as long as it is in the barrel so as to obtain the highest velocity. 
Cannon powder has the largest granules, up to thumb-sized cylinders with seven perforations (one central and the other six in a circle halfway to the outside of the cylinder's end faces). The perforations stabilize the burn rate because as the outside burns inward (thus shrinking the burning surface area) the inside is burning outward (thus increasing the burning surface area, but faster, so as to fill up the increasing volume of barrel presented by the departing projectile).   Fast-burning 
pistol powders are made by extruding shapes with more area such as flakes or by flattening the spherical granules.  Drying is usually performed under a vacuum.  The solvents are condensed and recycled. The granules are also coated with 
graphite to prevent static electricity sparks from causing undesired ignitions.




History


Military commanders had been complaining since the 

Napoleonic Wars
 about the problems of giving orders on a battlefield that was covered in thick smoke from the 
gunpowder used by the guns. A major step forward was introduced when 
guncotton, a 
nitrocellulose-based material, was first introduced by 
Christian Friedrich Schonbein in 1846. He also promoted its use as a blasting explosive.


Guncotton was more powerful than gunpowder, but at the same time was somewhat more unstable. This made it unsuitable as a propellant for small firearms: not only was it dangerous under field conditions, but guns that could fire thousands of rounds using gunpowder would be  used up  after only a few hundred with the more powerful guncotton. It did find wide use with artillery. However, within a short time there were a number of massive explosions and fatalities in guncotton factories due to lack of appreciation of its sensitivity and the means of stabilization. Guncotton then went out of use for some twenty years or more until it could be tamed; it was not until the 1880s that it became a viable propellant.


In 1884 
Paul Vieille invented a  smokeless gunpowder called 


Poudre B

, made from gelatinized guncotton mixed with 
ether and 
alcohol. It was passed through rollers to form thin sheets, which were cut into flakes of the desired size. The resulting 
propellant, today known as pyrocellulose, contains somewhat less 
nitrogen than guncotton and is less volatile. A particularly good feature of the propellant is that it will not detonate unless it is compressed, making it very safe to handle under normal conditions.


Vieille's powder revolutionized the effectiveness of small guns, for several reasons.  First, it gave off almost no smoke. After a few shots, a soldier with black powder ammunition would have his view obscured by a huge pall of smoke unless there was a strong wind.  Conversely, a 
sniper or other hidden shooter would not be given away by a cloud of smoke over the firing position. Further, it was three times more powerful than black powder, which gave more power from less powder.  The higher 
muzzle velocity meant a flatter 
trajectory and therefore more accurate long range fire, out to perhaps 1000 metres in the first smokeless powder rifles.  Since less powder was needed to propel a bullet, the 
cartridge could be made smaller and lighter. This allowed troops to carry more ammunition for the same weight.  Also, it would burn even when wet.  Black powder ammunition had to be kept dry and was almost always stored and transported in watertight cartridges.


Vielle's powder was used in the 
Lebel rifle that was immediately introduced by the 

French Army
  to exploit its huge benefits over black powder. Other European countries swiftly followed and started using their own versions of Poudre B, the first being 

Germany
 and 

Austria
 which introduced new weapons in 1888.


Meanwhile, in 

Great Britain
, in 1887, 

Alfred Nobel
 developed a smokeless gunpowder called 


Ballistite

. A modified form of this was devised by Sir 

Frederick Abel
 and 

James Dewar
 which eventually became known as 
Cordite, leading to a lengthy court battle between Nobel and the other two inventors over alleged British 
patent infringement. In the 
USA, in 1890, a patent for smokeless powder was obtained by 

Hudson Maxim
.


These newer propellants were more stable and thus safer to handle than Poudre B, and also more powerful. Today, propellants based on nitrocellulose alone are known as single-base, whereas cordite-like mixtures are known as double-base. A triple-base flashless cordite was also developed, primarily for large 
naval guns, but also used in battle 
tank ammunition.


Smokeless powder allowed the development of modern semi- and fully automatic firearms.  Burnt blackpowder leaves a thick, heavy fouling which is both 
hygroscopic and 
corrosive.  Smokeless powder fouling exhibits none of these properties.  This makes an autoloading firearm with many moving parts feasible (which would otherwise jam or seize under heavy blackpowder fouling).


Single and double-base smokeless powders now make up the vast majority of propellants used in firearms. They are so common that most modern references to  gunpowder  refer to a smokeless powder, particularly when referring to 
small arms ammunition.




Instability and stabilization


Nitrocellulose deteriorates with time, yielding acidic byproducts. Those byproducts catalyze the further deterioration, increasing its rate. The released heat, in case of bulk storage of the powder, or too large blocks of solid propellant, can cause self-ignition of the material. Single-base nitrocellulose propellants are most susceptible to degradation; double-base and triple-base propellants tend to deteriorate more slowly. To neutralize the decomposition products, which could otherwise cause corrosion of metals of the cartridges and gun barrels, 
calcium carbonate is added to some formulations.


To prevent buildup of the deterioration products, 
stabilizers are added. 









2-Nitrodiphenylamine








 is one of the most common stabilizers used. Others are 
4-nitrodiphenylamine, 
N-nitrosodiphenylamine, 
N-methyl-p-nitroaniline, and 
diphenylamine. The stabilizers are added in the amount of 0.5-2% of the total amount of the formulation; higher amounts tend to degrade its ballistic properties. The amount of the stabilizer is depleted with time. Propellants in storage should be periodically tested on the remaining amount of stabilizer, as its depletion may lead to autoignition of the propellant.




Smokeless propellant components


The propellant formulations may contain various energetic and auxiliary components:



 Propellants:


 
Nitrocellulose, an energetic component of most smokeless propellants


 







Nitroglycerin






, an energetic component of double-base and triple-base formulations


 




Nitroguanidine

tin dioxide


 
Bismuth metal and compounds, e.g. 
bismuth trioxide, 
bismuth subcarbonate, 
bismuth nitrate, 
bismuth antimonide; the bismuth compounds are favored as copper dissolves in molten bismuth, forming brittle and easily removable alloy


 
Lead foil and lead compounds, phased out due to toxicity


 Flash reducers, to reduce the brightness of the 
muzzle flash


 
Potassium nitrate


 

Potassium sulfate
 (both have a disadvantage - production of smoke)

Titanium dioxide


 
Polyurethane jackets over the powder bags, in large guns


 Other additives


 
Graphite, a 
lubricant to cover the grains and prevent them from sticking together, and to dissipate 
static electricity


 
Calcium carbonate, to neutralize acidic decomposition products




The properties of the propellant are greatly influenced by the size and shape of its grains. The surface of the grains influences the speed of burning, and the shape influences the surface and its change during burning. By selection of the grain shape it is possible to influence the pressure vs time curve as the propellant burns.


Faster-burning propellants generate higher temperatures and higher pressures, however they also increase the wear of the gun barrels.

Chrysler engines







Chrysler's B engine was a 
big-block 
V8 which replaced the early 






Chrysler FirePower engine





 in 1958. It did not have hemispherical heads like the FirePower   rather it had wedge-shaped heads. All B-series engines have a 3.375 inches (85.7 mm) 
stroke. Chrysler also produced a larger version, the 






Chrysler RB engine





.


Design features include 17 capscrews per cylinder head, a cylinder block that extends 3 inches below the crankshaft centerline, an intake manifold not exposed to crankcase oil on the underside, stamped-steel, shaft-mounted rocker arms (race versions used forged steel rockers), and a front-mounted oil pump driven by the camshaft.


The B engine started at 350 cu in (5.7 L) and 361 cu in (5.9 L), and a 383 cu in (6.3 L) version appeared the next year. 
Plymouth called its version of the early B Golden Commando. It produced 305 brake horsepower (227 kW). 









DeSoto








's B engine was the Turboflash. It put out 295 brake horsepower (220 kW). 
Dodge's B was called the D-500 and produced 320 brake horsepower (240 kW).



350


The 350 cu in (5.7 L) B engine had a bore of 4.0625 inches (103.19 mm) and was only produced in 1958. It was used on the following cars:

.
The 383 cu in (6.3 L) short-stroke B engine used a 4.25 inches (108 mm) bore and was introduced in 1959 for the 1960 model year. Over 3,000,000 B 383 engines were produced between 1959 and 1971. Dodge's version, the D500, had a cross-ram induction manifold and dual 4-barrel 
carburetors as options. In some Dodge applications, this engine was labelled as the Magnum, while the Plymouth's version was called the  Golden Commando. The  Golden Commando  came with a special
[] dual-point distributor, a drag-racing derivation.

Economics






 This article is about the economic concept of overproduction. For the musical term, see 
overproduction (music).


In 
economics, overproduction refers to excess of supply over demand of products being offered to the 
market. Leads to lower prices and / or unsold goods.


 Explanation 


Insufficient 
Effective demand or 
aggregate demand, so that there is an unplanned accumulation of 
inventories. It is caused by production to a forecast or plan that proves to be inaccurate; which all plans in a market will be to a greater or lesser degree except by chance. 


Where a product is produced to a specification that exceeds the specification required by the customer. This overproduction therefore produces unrequired features that the customer does not value.


Overproduction is one of the  7 Wastes  identified by 

Taiichi Ohno
 of Toyota as part of the 


Toyota Production System

 and latterly 
Lean.Economics also refers to much reproduction of a certain group of animals   or people.




 Say's Law 



Whilst some might think that the existence of general overproduction, if confirmed, would contradict 
Say's Law. Say's Law states that  The more goods (for which there is demand) that are produced, the more those goods (supply) can constitute a demand for other goods . It is central to the 
















Marxian















 theory of 
crisis and to 

Keynesian economics
. 


Overproduction differs from 
underconsumption, in which the excess supply results only from low consumer demand. Whether one is distinguishable from the other objectively is debatable. Overproduction can also arise due to low 
fixed investment, low net exports, or contractionary 
fiscal or 
monetary policy.

London Pact (

Italian
 Patto di Londra), or more correctly, the Treaty of London, 1915, was a secret 
pact between 
Italy and 




Triple Entente



, signed in 

London
 on 
26 April 
1915 by the Kingdom of Italy, the 
United Kingdom, 

France
 and 

Russia
.

According to the pact, Italy was to leave the 















Triple Alliance














 and join Triple Entente, as already stated in a secret agreement signed in London, on 4-5 September 1914. Furthermore, Italy was to 
declare war against 

Germany
 and 

Austria-Hungary
 within a month   and in fact the declaration of war was published 
23 May of the same year. In exchange, Italy was to obtain some territorial gains(see 
Italia irredenta) at the end of the war.

Austrian

 the coast and islands south of

 (Ragusa), and peninsula 
Pelje ac (Sabbioncello).




The 

Kingdom of Montenegro
 was assigned 






Dubrovnik




and the coast south to the

n port 
Shengjin (San Giovanni di Medua).




Also, but less precisely, Serbia was promised 









Bosnia




 and 





Herzegovina

Ba ka 



Slavonia (this one against the Italian objections),


 and some unspecified areas of Albania (to be divided between Serbia, Montenegro, and Greece).




The Italians insisted, and the Allies agreed, that the question of the 

Croatia
n coast between Zara and Istria should be settled after the war. They also insisted that Serbia should not be informed about the agreements. This, however, the Allies overruled by sending to the Government of Serbia an official Note, dated 
4 August 
1915, confirming the postwar territorial claims of Serbia and Montenegro. 


The pact was to be kept secret, but after the 





October Revolution




, it was published by Russian journal 










Izvestia









, in November 1917.


At the Paris Peace Conference, the Italians insisted that they would negotiate only with their wartime allies Serbia and Montenegro, not with defeated enemies included in delegation of the new 
Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. In particular they were incensed that three members of the delegation were former Austro-Hungarian deputies (Croats 
Ante Trumbi , 
Josip Smodlaka, and the Slovene 
Otokar Ribar ), and that one (the Slovene 
Ivan  olger) had served as Minister in the wartime Austrian Cabinet.


The pact was nullified with the 

Treaty of Versailles
, because 



Woodrow Wilson


, supporting Slavic claims and not recognizing the treaty, rejected Italian requests on Dalmatian territories.


The Partition of the Tyrol was confirmed by the 
Treaty of St. Germain.

Destination Moon is a 
1950 








American







 
science fiction 
feature film produced by 
George Pal, who later produced 

When Worlds Collide
, 
The War of the Worlds, and 

The Time Machine
. Pal commissioned the script by 
James O'Hanlon and 
Rip Van Ronkel. The film was directed by 


Irving Pichel

, was shot in 
Technicolor and was distributed in the USA by 
Eagle-Lion Classics.


Four American astronauts blast off from the New Mexico desert and fly to the 
Moon. They land after difficulties that cause more fuel to be used than anticipated. Consequently, the crew must race against time to lighten the ship for a successful return to 
Earth.


The film features the premise that US private industry will finance and manufacture the first spacecraft to reach the moon, given the 
Soviet threat at the time, and then the US government will bring itself to buy or lease the technology. Visionary industrialists are shown cooperating to support the venture.


Destination Moon was the first major science-fiction film dealing seriously with the prospect, problems and technology of space travel produced in the 








United States







, and won the 



Academy Award for Visual Effects


 in the name of the effects director, (

Lee Zavitz
). The film was also nominated for the 



Academy Award for Best Art Direction


. The eminent science-fiction writer 



Robert A. Heinlein


 contributed significantly to the script and served as a technical advisor. Heinlein also published, about the same time as the release of the film,  








Destination Moon







.  a novella of the same name that was based on the screenplay.


The film was promoted through an unprecedented onslaught of publicity in the print media. Seven years before 
Sputnik, the movie clearly spells out a rationale for the 
space race: unnamed enemies (clearly understood at the time to be the Soviets) are sabotaging the American space program, and unless the West beats them to the moon, they will establish a strategic advantage to conquer the world.


Destination Moon includes an animated segment of 







Woody Woodpecker






 illustrating the basics of space flight. The segment serves to educate not only certain characters in the story, but the audience as well. As a narrative device, this technique has been employed in subsequent films, such as 

Jurassic Park
.


The film shows the rocket being constructed in situ in the desert, and 
Lockheed aircraft plant in Southern California is shown with workers examining a model of the nuclear spacecraft. Transitional sequences show Lockheed Constellations being assembled. The fictional rocket uses 
nuclear thermal propulsion, a method that has not been employed in actual rocket launches to date.


This movie was not the first such to hit the screens, however; 

Rocketship X-M
 stole its thunder. The sets and costumes were re-used in films subsequently, and even appear in the second episode of 

The Time Tunnel
. Both Destination Moon and Rocketship X-M contain a polemical element, but with almost diametrically opposed messages: where Rocketship X-M contains a seriously intended anti-nuclear message, Destination Moon has a nuclear-powered spacecraft taking off in defiance of a court order, and depicts the court order as inspired by irrational fear. Once on the moon, the crew find evidence that the moon is a source of uranium.


A relationship between the film and Heinlein's novel 





Rocket Ship Galileo




 exists. In the novel, the astronauts are high school boys led by an older scientist, the enemies are the Nazis rather than the Soviets, and the emphasis is on conflict with them. In the movie, sabotage is only vaguely hinted at, the concept of a space race is introduced, the voyage is a massive industrial undertaking, and the plot revolves around the dangers of the voyage. A common element in both stories is that the rocket takes off in defiance of a court order. The movie is in fact more similar to Heinlein's novella 








The Man Who Sold the Moon







, which according to its copyright date was written by 1949, although it was not published until 1951, the year after Destination Moon premiered.


The matte and scene paintings for Destination Moon were created by the famous astronomical artist 





Chesley Bonestell




. Pal also employed Bonestell for work on When Worlds Collide from the novel by Philip Wylie and Edwin Balmer; The Conquest of Space, which in turn was based on the book by Willy Ley and Bonestell; and The War of the Worlds, notably the opening sequence featuring cleverly animated astronomical paintings of the planets by Bonestell.



Adaptations


Episode 12 of the 


Dimension X

 radio series was called Destination Moon and was based on Heinlein's input to the script of the movie.


A highly condensed version of the story was released on a 78 rpm disk by 

Capitol Records
 in 1950 as part of the  Bozo Approved  series, under the title of Destination Moon (Adapted From The George Pal Production by Charles Palmer)1.  The narrator was Tom Reddy; Billy May composed incidental and background music.  The story took considerable liberties with the film's plot and characters, though the general shape of the story remains.

Open Question Argument

Philosophical arguments





The Open Question Argument is a philosophical 
argument put forward by the British philosopher 
G. E. Moore in 
|13 of Principia Ethica''. It sets out to demonstrate the predicate  good  cannot be defined using natural terms: Good cannot be called blue, or rough, or smooth, or smelly - it lacks natural properties. That being said,  good,  Moore argued, is not a supernatural property. He merely said that trying to define it using natural terms led to the  




Naturalistic fallacy



 . Moore argues that the question of  What is good?  is an open one.


The argument hinges on the nature of statements such as  Anything that is pleasant is also good  and the possibility of asking questions such as  That thing is pleasant but is it good?  According to Moore, these questions are open and these statements are significant; and they will remain so no matter what is substituted for  pleasure . Moore concludes from this that any analysis of value is bound to fail. In other words, if value could be analyzed, then such questions and statements would be trivial and obvious. Since they are anything but trivial and obvious, value must be indefinable. 


Critics of Moore's arguments sometimes claim that he is appealing to general puzzles concerning analysis (cf. 
the paradox of analysis), rather than revealing anything special about value. Other responses appeal to the 
Fregean distinction between 
sense and reference, allowing that value concepts are special and sui generis, but insisting that value properties are nothing but natural properties (this strategy is similar to that taken by 
non-reductive materialists in 
philosophy of mind).


An important response to the open question argument by contemporary ethical naturalists (e.g., 










Peter Railton









) is to understand a claim like  goodness is identical with pleasure  as an 
a posteriori identity claim on a par with  Water is H2O . The question  This is H2O but is it water?  is intelligible and so, in that limited sense, whether or not water is H2O is an open question, note that this does not address the issue of significance. But that does not lead us to conclude that water is not H2O.  Water is H2O  is an identity claim that is known to be true 
a posteriori (i.e., it was discovered via empirical investigation). 


The fact that this truth is not known merely by conceptually analyzing the term  water  (and the corresponding fact that the aforementioned open question is at least intelligible) does not falsify the identity claim. Similarly, an ethical naturalist might argue that, say,  goodness is identical with pleasure  is an a posteriori identity claim whose truth is discovered empirically. That we can intelligibly ask  I see that this is pleasant, but is it good?  simply means that we cannot conceptually analyze  good  in terms of  pleasure . It does not mean that goodness is not the same thing as pleasure.  Good  and  pleasant  might pick out (refer to) the same thing. Whether or not this is the case is a matter of empirical investigation, and not conceptual analysis, according to this kind of ethical naturalist.


Others hold that it may be reasonable to assert, however, that the term  good  is merely an affirmation of approval, and that, as such, good may be defined as  I approve . In this context, questions such as  I see that this is pleasant, but is it good?  translate as  I see this is pleasant, I approve of pleasure . This however may raise the question  Why do I approve of pleasure?  this may lead to analysis of what 
pleasure means to 
living organisms to consider whether there is a purpose in seeking pleasure, which may lead to analysis of value in terms that relate to living organisms.

The Sequatchie  River drains the 



Sequatchie Valley


, a large valley in the 
Cumberland Plateau in 


Middle Tennessee

.



Hydrography


The Sequatchie River's source is a massive spring which flows out of Devilstep Hollow Cave, a large 
limestone 
cavern.  It receives the drainage of 




Grassy Cove



, a pastoral limestone region several miles to the north from which the drainage has no surface outlet, through a spectacular series of underground passages.  This cave is located in the southeastern portion of 

Cumberland County
, and the water flowing from it is augmented by that of other sizeable springs and small streams, at least one of which provided enough flow for an early 
textile industry. The stream crosses into 

Bledsoe County
 and is at the floor of a valley that trends generally southwestward and is several miles wide.  Natives of the area tend to call the portion of the Cumberland Plateau to the west of the valley the  Cumberland Mountains  or  the Plateau  and that to the east of it 


Walden Ridge

 or  Wallings Ridge .  The Sequatchie Valley is traversed throughout much its length by 
U.S. Highway 127.  The first sizeable town on the Sequatchie is 

Pikeville
. 
State Route 30, which descends Waldens Ridge into the Valley and then climbs the 
escarpment back onto the plateau, crosses here.


Crossing into 

Sequatchie County
, the stream flows into 

Dunlap
.  Just north of Dunlap, U.S. 127 turns southeastward, beginning the ascent onto Walden Ridge and eventually down into 

Chattanooga
. A set of railroad tracks runs along the river from here on, testament to heavy underground 
coal extraction in years past.  For almost the rest of its length the Sequatchie is paralleled by 
State Route 28.  
State Route 283 also runs along the base of the Waldens Ridge escarpment for several miles.  The river then enters 

Marion County
. The town of 

Whitwell
 is just a few miles into Marion County.  Below Whitwell at the small community of Sequatchie (also known as Sequachee) the Sequatchie receives the flow of the 



Little Sequatchie River


.  At 

Jasper
, which is slightly west of the river, is a railroad junction.  East of town is the crossing of 
U.S. Highway 41 by Tennessee 28, and the bridge over the river.  Shortly south of the 

Interstate 24
 bridge is the mouth of the Sequatchie into the 

Guntersville Lake
 impoundment of the 

Tennessee River
.

Postage stamps by country







3-pence value showing an island scene, 1939






A 
first-day cover franked with all of the four UPU stamps of 1949.




Originally 
mail service to the 
Gilbert and Ellice Islands was ad hoc, depending on which ships were calling at the various islands. A regular service began in 
1911; 


Edward VII

 
postage stamps of 

Fiji
 were 
overprinted GILBERT   ELLICE / PROTECTORATE and put on sale on 
1 January of that year, followed in March by a set of four stamps depicting a 
Pandanus tree, inscribed GILBERT   ELLICE ISLANDS / PROTECTORATE.


These were followed in 
1912 by 


George V

 stamps of the common type, inscribed GILBERT   ELLICE ISLANDS.  A new 
definitive series came out starting 
14 January, 
1939, featuring local scenery and a profile of 


George VI

.  These were updated in 
1956 with a profile of 


Elizabeth II

.


A set of four stamps on 
1 May 
1960 commemorated the 60th anniversary of the discovery of 
phosphate at 


Ocean Island

.  The definitive series of 
1965 depicted daily activities of the natives, but a 
decimal currency conversion necessitated 
surcharges in 
1966 and a reissue of the stamps in 
1968.  The colony issued about 10-15 stamps per year thereafter, usually as sets of four, until the end of 
1975.


In 1976, the islands became two separate colonies and later independent; see 
postage stamps and postal history of Kiribati and 
postage stamps and postal history of Tuvalu.

Idyllwild Arts Foundation encompasses two institutions in 
Idyllwild, California for training in the arts:  Idyllwild Arts Academy (IAA) and Idyllwild Arts Summer Program.  The institution was formerly known as Idyllwild School of Music and the Arts (ISOMATA).

Idyllwild Arts is in the mountains above 

Palm Springs, California
 in the 




San Bernardino National Forest



, at an elevation of 5300 feet, 2 hours from Los Angeles, 2 hours from San Diego and 1 hour from Palm Springs.



History


Idyllwild Arts (formerly Idyllwild School of Music and the Arts or ISOMATA) was founded by Dr. Max Krone and his wife, Beatrice. Envisioning a remote place where people of all backgrounds could come together to experience the arts, they established the Idyllwild Arts Foundation in 1946 and purchased acreage in the San Jacinto Mountains on which to build.  In 1950, approximately one hundred adult students began attending summer classes in the arts.  


Over the years, summer activities have continued to grow, expanding to include programs for children of all ages, a Family Camp, and the Distinguished Artist Residency series.  Classes in music, dance, theatre, visual arts, writing and Native American arts are offered to students from age 5 to 85.  Each year over 1800 adults and children attend Idyllwild Arts Summer Program courses.


In 1964, the school was given to the 


University of Southern California

 under the terms of an agreement with the Idyllwild Arts Foundation.  In 1983, the Foundation exercised its option to resume independent management and resumed sole ownership of the school.  In 1985, the first independent boarding high school for the arts in the western United States, the Idyllwild Arts Academy, was established.




Idyllwild Arts Academy


Idyllwild Arts Academy, the boarding school, specializes in pre-professional training, offering a college preparatory program for grades 9 12 and post-graduates, with training in music, theatre, dance, visual art, creative writing, moving pictures and interdisciplinary arts.  An audition or portfolio is required for admission.  Academic classes are held from 8:00 a.m. to 1:00 pm Monday Saturday and arts classes are held Monday Friday afternoons, with rehearsals in the evenings.


IAA is accredited by the 
Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC). 


Some students matriculate to programs such as 
Juilliard, 


University of Southern California

, 

New York University
 (



Tisch


), 

University of Michigan
, 

San Francisco Art Institute
, 
Curtis Institute, 

Rhode Island School of Design
,

, and 

Stanford University
.

, folk singer 


Pete Seeger

, composer 








Meredith Willson







, painter Francoise Gilot, Native American artist Fritz Scholder and photographer

 are just a few of the artists who have taught at Idyllwild Arts and helped set the standard for arts education in the Summer Program.


Each year, during an eight-week season, the Summer Program enrolls approximately 2000 students ages five to adult in more than 95 workshops, taught by professional artist-teachers, in dance, music theatre, visual arts, creative writing, poetry, filmmaking, and Native Arts. 


The program for young people features a Children's Center whose participants range in age from 5 to 12 and who select classes and workshops in a variety of arts including multi-arts, dance, piano, theatre, visual arts, poetry and journal writing.


Junior Artist's Center (ages 11 13) and Youth Arts Center (ages 13 18) offer courses to accommodate a broad range of skill levels and a wide variety of art experiences.

Writers can take poetry, fiction and playwriting workshops. Dancers participate in ballet, jazz and modern. Actors may take up to six weeks of Theatre Festival workshops, which includes a major performance. 


Each year, Idyllwild Arts provides financial aid for young people with limited financial resources to allow them the opportunity to explore the arts 25% of young people who participate in an arts workshop are awarded financial aid totaling approximately $200,000.


Part of the program involves theme-related workshops, seminars and performances featuring renowned artists, poets and musicians. Programs include: Painting's Edge, Native American Arts, Summer Poetry in Idyllwild, Chamber Music in Idyllwild and the Idyllwild Music Festival. 


The culmination of the Summer Program is celebrated with a concert by the Festival Choir, Festival Wind Ensemble and the Festival Orchestra.  In previous years this concert ended with a performance of

Sebago Lake







Steamboat Landing in c. 1910



Sebago Lake is the deepest and second largest 
lake in the 








U.S. state







 of 





Maine




.  The lake is 316 feet (96 m) deep at its deepest point, with a mean depth of 101 feet (31 m), covers about 45 square miles (117 km2) in surface area, has a length of 12 miles (19 km) and a shoreline length of 105 miles (169 km).1 The surface is around 270 feet (82 m) above sea level, so the deep bottom is below the present sea level.2  It is located in 

Cumberland County, Maine
 and bordered by the towns of 

Casco
, 

Naples
, 

Raymond
, 

Sebago
, 

Standish
 and 

Windham
.  The seasonally occupied town of 

Frye Island
 is on an island in the lake.3

The lake is connected to 

Brandy Pond
 by the Songo River and eventually to 
Long Lake in Naples. The name comes from a local 

Native American
 tribe. The lake is drained primarily by the Presumpscot River. Prior to construction of a railroad in 1870, Sebago Lake was linked to 

Portland
 harbor by the 
Cumberland and Oxford Canal.  The outlet to the river has been dammed since 1875 by the Eel Weir Dam and the Head Dam, owned and operated by the 




S. D. Warren Paper Mill



. 4 5



Water Supply


Sebago Lake is the primary 
water supply for the Portland Water District, which serves the Greater 

Portland
 region and about 15% of Maine's population.  The lake's watershed is more than 50 miles (80 km) long and covers parts of 24 Maine towns.6


The lake holds roughly 995 billion 
gallons of water that on average resides 5.1 to 5.4 years in the lake.  The direct watershed is about 171 square miles (443 km2) of land plus the 45 square miles (117 km2) of the lake, and the indirect watershed about 190 square miles (490 km2) of land plus about 28 square miles (73 km2) of other bodies of water.  As of May 1990, roughly 86% of the watershed was forests and fallow fields, 2.5% in active timber operations, 9.3% in residential, agricultural, and commercial use, and 2.2% used for other purposes.  Water inflow is estimated at 544 million gallons per day and outflow at 498 million gallons per day, of which 24 million gallons/day are for the water district.7




Recreation


In 1938, Maine opened 





Sebago Lake State Park




 as one of its original five state parks.  The area was a recreation center even before this.  The park is now 1,400 acres (mostly forested), open year-round, and has facilities including two public boat launches and a 250-site campground.8  There are also numerous private campgrounds, cottages, and other recreational facilities in the area. Sebago Lake is located in the portion of Maine that the Maine tourism industry refers to as the Western Lakes and Mountains Region. 



Fishing

  	 
The lake contains natural populations of land-locked salmon (
Salmo salar sebago) and 
smelt. When the last major glaciers retreated, the entire watershed was under seawater, and populations of these marine animals became established as the land rose and sea waters retreated.9 Other game fish that can be found in the lake include 
lake trout, 
brook trout, 
brown trout, 
smallmouth bass, 
largemouth bass, and 
northern pike.10 Some of these are stocked by the state, either in the lake directly or in connected bodies of water, while others were introduced illegally.11  The state encourages anglers to kill, hold, and notify them of all northern pike taken in the lake because they were introduced illegally, are not native to the region, and could disrupt the lake ecosystem.

Southern Manifesto
Dixiecrats
Political manifestos
1956 in law




The Southern Manifesto was a document written in February-March 
1956 by legislators in the 

United States Congress
 opposed to racial integration in public places.1 The manifesto was signed by 99 Democrats and 2 Republicans (101 politicians) from 





Alabama




, 

Arkansas
, 

Florida
, 

Georgia
, 





Louisiana




, 

Mississippi
, 





North Carolina




, 









South Carolina








, 





Tennessee




, 


Texas

, and 

Virginia
. 1 The document was largely drawn up to counter the landmark Supreme Court 1954 ruling 

Brown v. Board of Education
, which integrated public schools. The initial version  was written by 


Strom Thurmond

 and the final version mainly by 

Richard Russell
.2 The manifesto was signed by 19 Senators and 81 members of the 

House of Representatives
, including the entire congressional delegations of the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina and Virginia.  All of the signatories were 
Southern Democrats but two: Republicans 





Joel Broyhill




 and 










 Richard Poff









 of Virginia. School segregation laws were some of the most enduring and best-known of the 
Jim Crow laws that characterized the 
American South and several northern states at the time.

The Southern Manifesto accused the Supreme Court of  clear abuse of judicial power.   It further promised to use  all lawful means to bring about a reversal of this decision which is contrary to the Constitution and to prevent the use of force in its implementation.  3 



 Key Quotes 


 The unwarranted decision of the Supreme Court in the public school cases is now bearing the fruit always produced when men substitute naked power for established law. 


 The original Constitution does not mention education. Neither does the 14th Amendment nor any other amendment. The debates preceding the submission of the 14th Amendment clearly show that there was no intent that it should affect the system of education maintained by the States. 


 This unwarranted exercise of power by the Court, contrary to the Constitution, is creating chaos and confusion in the States principally affected. It is destroying the amicable relations between the white and Negro races that have been created through 90 years of patient effort by the good people of both races. It has planted hatred and suspicion where there has been heretofore friendship and understanding. 




Signatories and Non-Signatories


In many southern States, signing was much more common than not signing. Those from southern States who refused to sign are noted below.1 Refusal to sign occurred most prominently among the Texan and Tennessee delegations, where the majority of members of the 

United States House of Representatives
 refused to sign.1

Hairdressing







Hair styled with hair gel



Hair gel is a hairstyling product that is used to stiffen 
hair into a particular 
hairstyle. The results it produces are usually similar to but stronger than those of 
hair spray and weaker than those of hair glue or 
hair wax. 
A version of gel, known as  Mousse , was patented in the mid-1980s by Michael J. Hoover.

Many brands of hair 
gel in North America and the United Kingdom come in numbered variants. Higher numbered gels maintain a greater  hold  on hair, while lower numbers do not make the hair as 
stiff and in some products give the hair a wet look. A category typically referred to as  ethnic  gels are designed and manufactured specifically for sculpting the hair texture common to African Americans. 


 Ampro Industries

 is a common example of this category. 


Some forms of hair gel include temporary 
Hair coloring for the hair, including variants in unnatural colors associated with various 
subcultures, and is popular within the 
goth and 
raver subcultures. 



Cationic polymers



Cationic polymers are one of the main functional component of hair gel.  The positive charges in polymer cause it to stretch, making the gel more 
viscous. 
Hair gel withholds procedures that allow men and women to make their hair styled and textured in ways they desire.This is because the stretched-out polymer takes up more space than a coiled polymer and thus resists the flow of solvent molecules around it. The positive charges also bind the gel to the negatively charged 
amino acids on the surface of the 
keratin molecules in the hair. More complicated polymer formulas exist, e.g. a 
copolymer of 
vinylpyrrolidone, 
methacrylamide, and 
N-vinylimidazole.1

Political corruption

Political scandals




The Santer Commission was the 



European Commission


 in office between 
23 January 
1995 and 
15 March 
1999. The administration was led by 

Jacques Santer
 (former 
Prime Minister of Luxembourg).

The body had 20 members and oversaw the introduction of the 
euro. It was cut short when the Commission became the first to resign en masse due to allegations of corruption. Some members continued under 
Manuel Marin until the 


Prodi Commission

 was appointed.



Appointment



In 1994 

Jacques Delors
 was due to step down from a successful tenure as 

President of the European Commission
. However his federalist style was not to the liking of many national governments. Hence when the proposal of 

Jean-Luc Dehaene
 (the then-
Prime Minister of Belgium) was presented, he was vetoed by the UK on the grounds he was too federalist. 

Jacques Santer
, then-
Prime Minister of Luxembourg, was seen as less federalist as his 

presidency
 had earlier proposed the 


pillar structure

. Hence he was nominated and approved by the 




European Council



 on 
1994-07-15.1


Hence he was seen as being the  second choice  which weakened his position, with the 

European Parliament
 approving him only by a narrow majority.1 Santer himself admitted that he  was not the first choice - but to become Commission president was not my first choice either. 2 He did however flex his powers over the nominations for the other 
Commissioners. The President gained this power under the 

Maastricht Treaty
 that came into force the previous year. On 
1995-01-18 managed to get his Commission approved by Parliament by 416 votes to 103 (a larger majority than expected) and they were appointed by the Council on 23 January.1




Early work


The Santer Commission oversaw the development of the 

Treaty of Nice
 before it was signed in 2000, negotiations with those 
countries to join in 2004 and the signing of the 

Amsterdam Treaty
 in 1997.3


Notably it contributed to the development of the 
euro and issued a series of 
green papers based on Commissioner 







Yves-Thibault de Silguy






's work. The Commission also developed the 






euro currency symbol





. The euro was established on 
1999-01-01. The Commission also continued Delor's social agenda, pushed for more powers in that field including tackling 
unemployment and began proposals for the reform of the 




Common Agricultural Policy



.1


Santer, desiring a quotable slogan for his administration, stated his Commissions aim would be  to do less, but do it better  (a slogan adopted and adapted by many since, but not yet fulfilled by the Commission). Although just a 
sound bite, it touched a chord for some thinking the Community needed a rest after the new treaties and the euro, even if the nature of the Community itself requires movements and new projects to keep it busy.2 However, during 1998 the Commission began to loose authority due to management criticisms from the Parliament.1




Budget controversy


The 






community's budget





 for each year needs to be discharged by the Parliament following its report by the 







European Court of Auditors






. It had only done so previously in 1984.4 Towards the end of 1998 the Parliament's 


Committee on Budgetary Control

 initially refused to discharge the 






community's budget





 for 1996 over what it saw as the arrogance of the Commission in its refusal to answer questions relating to financial mismanagement.5 

Paul van Buitenen
, a 
whistle-blower working in the Commission, had sent the Parliament a report alleging that widespread fraud and cover ups, stating:  I found strong indications that . . . auditors have been hindered in their investigations and that officials received instructions to obstruct the audit examinations . . . The commission is a closed culture and they want to keep it that way, and my objective is to open it up, to create more transparency and to put power where it belongs - and that's in the democratically-elected European Parliament.  In response, the Commission suspended him on half pay for releasing details of an inquiry.6





However it eventually supported the discharge 14 to 13 on 11 December, recommending that the plenary support the discharge. It was taken to plenary for debate four days later however the assigned rapporteur publicly went against the Committee's official position and urged the plenary to reject the discharge motion. President Santer announced that the Commission would treat the vote of discharge as 
one of confidence. In a vote on 
1998-12-17, the Parliament denied the discharge.7


In response, on the basis it was tantamount to a vote of no confidence, the President of PES, 


Pauline Green

, announced she would put forward a 
motion of censure. However PES would vote against its own motion, as there is no method for a motion of confidence. During this period, the Parliament took on an increase government-opposition dynamic, with PES as a party supporting the Commission and the EPP renouncing its support and acting as a de-facto opposition party to the executive.7 This is in part because the allegations centred on 
Edith Cresson and 
Manuel Marin, both from the 

Socialist party
 (PES). It was seen by some that it was an attempt by the 

People's party
 (EPP) to discredit PES ahead of the 






1999 elections





. This led to hesitation from the PES leadership, who were the largest group in Parliament, to support the allegations.5 Motions tabled by the two groups outlined the differing stances the EPP favouring individual responsibility (just those whom the main allegations are against) and PES favouring an emphasis on collective responsibility (so EPP members such as the President, as well as PES members, would be forced to resign). The PES resolution also proposed establishing a committee of independent experts to investigate the allegations.7




Resignation


Following negotiations, including national capitals pressuring their MEPs,5 the Parliament met to vote on the resolutions on January 14, 1999. It accepted the PES resolution and turned down a censure motion 293 to 232. Hence the Committee of Independent Experts was set up with its members appointed by the political leaders in Parliament and the Commission to create a balance.7 A number of high profile figures8 were appointed and President Santer agreed to  respond  to its findings.5 The report was produced on 
1999-03-15 and was presented to the Commission and Parliament. It largely cleared most members, aside from Cresson, but concluded that there was growing reluctance of the Commissioners to acknowledge responsibility and that  It was becoming increasingly difficult to find anyone who had the slightest sense of responsibility. 7





The entire Santer Commission resigned in response to the report



In response to the report, PES withdrew their support from the Commission7 and joined the other groups stating that unless the Commission resigned of their own accord, they would be forced to do so. So, on the night of March 15th, Santer announced the mass resignation of his Commission.7 The morning following the resignation, against the recommendation of his advisors, Santer attacked the conclusions of Committee. The report was seen to be even in criticising not only PES members and of criticising the workings of the Commission itself. It also exposed the situation that Parliament, nor the President, could force the resignation of an individual Commissioner as they could only be 'recalled' by national governments. Paris refused to recall Cresson,5 who refused to resign of her own accord, which sparked the need for a mass resignation. Commissioner 







Mario Monti






 criticised this stating that  This Commission has collectively resigned, I believe, not because of collective responsibility but because certain members of it preferred not to take their own individual responsibilities. 9 Edith Cresson went before the 

European Court of Justice
 and, in July 2006, was found guilty but was not stripped of her pension.10 Cresson today is largely held accountable for the fall of Santer, who went on to serve time as an MEP and never fully recovered, and the rest of his Commission.2




Repercussions


The immediate effects was that the politically weakened Commission was unable to react to the beginning of the 

Kosovo War
 and the close of the Agenda 2000 negotiations. The crisis had compounded the already reduced powers of the Commission in favour of the Parliament's legislative power, the Council's foreign policy role and the ECB's financial role. However the change with Parliament was the most profound, the previous permanent cooperation between the two bodies came to an end with the shift in power.11


It was hoped by the leaders in Parliament that such a political challenge would generate useful publicity ahead of the elections, with previous polls producing a low turn out with a perception of the body being powerless. In this respect the affair did generate extensive media attention with the Parliament now seeming 'dramatic'. The committee report also was written in an unusually accessible manner, filled with 
soundbites. Further more it also drew greater attention from the Council to a Parliament willing to exercise its powers. Hence when the Council came in to agree on a new President, it was clear that the candidate had to be acceptable to parliament.5 The crisis also displayed the increasing party competition within the Parliament, leading to the development of a Parliamentary system between the executive and legislative branches. Indeed it can be seen that the government-opposition dynamic of the two main parties in Parliament aggravated the development of the crisis and contributed to the downfall of the Commission.7


The 


Prodi Commission

, which succeeded Marin's caretaker administration, announced a zero-tolorance approach to fraud. Following pressure from Parliament, the Commission quickly established 






OLAF





, an anti-fraud office which replaced the Unit for the Co-ordination of Fraud Protection (UCLAF) established in 198812 and seen as having failed in its duty.1 OLAF was established with more powers and to be more independent, especially in terms of investigation where they are formally autonomous from the Commission.12 There were a few members who survived the Santer Commission to continue under Prodi: 








Franz Fischler







, 











Erkki Liikanen










, 







Mario Monti






 and 

Neil Kinnock
. The latter was put in charge of the much needed institutional reform.1 


The reappointment of some of these members showed that individual Commissioners still maintained their own reputations despite the massive loss of face of the institution as a whole, while Cresson would have never been able to have been reappointed. The Commission itself suffered from a loss of trust and reputation, only compounded by the post-Delors mood. Prodi had to deal with increased euroscepticism which helped bring down the Santer Commission. Since the end of the Delors era, pro-integrationism had given way with greater concern about the Commission's powers. By just 2000 the Council curbed the Commission's powers once more when they believed Prodi overstepped his remit.11




College


The Commission college had 20 members (two for the largest four member states, one each for the remainder) and included Commissioners from new member states Sweden, Finland and Austria. Had Norway not rejected EU membership in 1995, their Commissioner would have been

13th century disestablishments
Middle Ages
Christianity of the Middle Ages
989 establishments




The Peace and Truce of God was a 
medieval European movement of the 
Catholic Church that applied spiritual sanctions in order to limit the violence of 
private war in 
feudal society. The movement constituted the first organized attempt to control civil society in medieval Europe through non-violent means. It began with very limited provisions in 
989 and survived in some form to the thirteenth century.


Overview


The Peace and Truce of God movement was one of the ways that the Church attempted to Christianize and pacify the feudal structures of society through non-violent means. After the collapse of the 
Carolingian empire in the ninth century, France had degenerated into many small counties and lordships, in which local lords and knights frequently fought each other for control. At the same time there were often attacks from the 
Vikings, who settled in northern France as the 


Normans

 but continued to raid territory further inland. 


In times such as this, when a region was suffering from disorder due to local conflicts, the local clergy, such as abbots, heads of 
monasteries, and bishops, would hold a town council. Invitations would be issued to nearby nobles demanding that they attend. Assuming the nobles showed up, the clergy would bring all the saints' 
relics they had available. These relics could include bits of bone, vials of blood, clothing from saints - anything that had at one time come in to physical contact with a saint. These would often be heaped in a pile or displayed dramatically and the clergy would use these relics to induce fear of the saints, fear of spiritual retribution, to intimidate the nobility to persuade them to promise to obey the Peace and Truce of God. The belief in the power of saints' relics was very strong.


Often, however, nobles simply did not show up and would ignore the invitation. In addition, nobles would often not swear to obey, or if they did, they would later break their promise. If a promise was made, it had to be renewed and documents show a renewal decade after decade in certain regions. The movement was not very effective.  In trying to control warfare without the use of physical coercion it rapidly foundered on the rocks of a violent feudal reality.  (Richard Landes). However it set a precedent that would be followed by other successful popular movements to control nobles violence such as 
medieval communes, and the 
Crusades.


In addition to the Peace and Truce of God movement other non-violent, although less direct, methods of controlling violence were used by the clergy. By adding the religious oaths of 
fealty to the feudal act of 
homage, and in organizing rights and duties within the system, churchmen did their utmost to Christianize feudal society in general and to set limits on feudal violence in particular. This can be seen as combining the spiritual (potestas) and secular authority (auctoritas) in a dual concerted action that had defined the idea of Christian government since the fifth century.


The two movements began at separate times and places, but by the eleventh century they became synonymous as the  Peace and Truce of God .




Peace of God


The Peace of God or Pax Dei was a proclamation issued by local clergy that granted immunity from violence to noncombatants who could not defend themselves beginning with the peasants (agricolae) and the clergy. A limited pax Dei was decreed at the 
Synod of Charroux in 
989 and spread to most of Western Europe over the next century,1 surviving in some form until at least the thirteenth century. 


At the Benedictine abbey of Charroux in 
La Marche on the borders of the 

Aquitaine
  a great crowd of many people (populus) gathered there from the 





Poitou




, the 





Limousin




, and neighboring regions. Many bodies of saints were also brought there  bringing miracles in their wake.2 Three canons promulgated at Charroux, under the leadership of 









Gombald, Archbishop of Bordeaux








 and 





Gascony




, were signed by the bishops of Poitiers, Limoges, Perigueux, Saintes and Angouleme, all in the west of France, beyond the limited jurisdiction of 

Hugh Capet
. 
Excommunication would be the punishment for attacking or robbing a church, for robbing peasants or the poor of farm animals among which the ass is mentioned but not the horse which would have been beyond the reach of a peasant and for robbing, striking or seizing a priest or any man of the clergy who is not bearing arms.  Making compensation or reparations could circumvent the anathema of the Church.


Children and  women (virgins and widows) were added to the early protections. The Pax Dei prohibited nobles from invading churches, beating the defenseless, burning houses, and so on. Merchants and their goods were added to the protected groups in a 
synod of 1033. Significantly, the Peace of God movement began in 

Aquitaine
, 
Burgundy and 






Languedoc





, areas where central authority had most completely fragmented.


The tenth-century foundation of the 
Abbey of Cluny aided the development of the Peace of God. Cluny was independent of any secular authority, subject to the Papacy alone, and while all church territory was inviolate, Cluny's territory extended far beyond its own boundaries. A piece of land 30 km in diameter was considered to be part of Cluny itself, and any smaller monastery that allied itself with Cluny was granted the same protection from violence. This grant was given at a Peace of God council in 





Anse




 in 
994. The monastery was also immune from 
excommunications, 
interdicts, and 
anathemas, which would normally affect an entire region. The abbey of 
Fleury was granted similar protection. Not coincidentally, many of the Cluniac monks were members of the same knightly class whose violence they were trying to stop. 


 Peace of God  can also be used as a general term that means  under the protection of the Church  and was used in multiple contexts in medieval society. For example, pilgrims who traveled on 
Crusade did so under the  peace of God  ie. under the protection of the Church. This general usage of the term is not always related to the Peace and Truce of God movement.


Romans in the 
pagan traditions commonly used a similar phrase  peace of the gods , meaning when the gods were at peace, when the gods were not causing trouble, such as earthquakes or war, otherwise known as Ira Deorum (The Wrath of the Gods). The object of Roman religion was to secure the cooperation, benevolence, and  peace  of the gods, hence Pax Deorum.




Truce of God


The Truce of God or Treuga Dei extended the Peace by setting aside certain days of the year when violence was not allowed. Where the Peace of God prohibited violence against the church and the poor, the Truce of God was more focused on preventing violence between Christians, specifically between knights. It became a convention among the seigneurs of 






Roussillon





 and 


Catalonia

 and was first proclaimed in 
1027 at the Council of 





Toulouges




  a town of Roussillon   which was presided over by 












Oliba











, bishop of 

Vic
, the first notable patron of the movement.  An initial ban on fighting on Sundays and holy days was extended to include all of Lent, and even the Friday of every week.


The eighteenth-century historian 

Edward Gibbon
 detected a parallel among the 
pagan German tribes who worshipped a goddess of the earth who resided at the island of 
Rugen, who annually travelled to visit the tribes.  During her progress the sound of war was hushed, quarrels were suspended, arms laid aside, and the restless Germans had an opportunity of tasting the blessings of peace and harmony.  The truce of God, so often and so ineffectually proclaimed by the clergy of the eleventh century, was an obvious imitation of this ancient custom. 3

Korea-Tongdosa-01.jpg

   




Tongdosa is a major 
Chogye Buddhist temple, and is one of the 

Three Jewel Temples of Korea
. It represents the 


Buddha

, and is located on 
Yeonchuk-san in 

Yangsan
 City, 

Gyeongsangnam-do
, 

South Korea
. It was founded in 
646 CE by the monk 

Jajang
, during the reign of 

Queen Seondeok of Silla
.  It thrived throughout the 

Unified Silla
 and 

Goryeo
 periods, when Buddhism was the state religion, and remained strong even in the 

Joseon Dynasty
.  Only one building, the daeungjeon hall, survived the 
Japanese invasions of Korea in the late 16th century; the other buildings were rebuilt after that time.

Tongdosa is often called  The temple without a Buddha  because it contains no outdoor statues of the Buddha, rather it is arranged around several 
stupas which contain Jajang's precious gifts, and reputedly, relics of the historical Buddha, including his robe, begging bowl, and a bone from his skull.

Poetry




The 
British Army presence in 

Egypt
 in 







World War II






 had as a side-effect the concentration of a group of Cairo poets. There had in fact been a noticeable literary group in 

Cairo
 before the war in 
North Africa broke out, including university academics. Possibly as a reflection of that, there were two strands of literary activity and publication during the years 1942-1944. There was the Personal Landscape group centred on the publication of that name, founded by 



Lawrence Durrell


, 
Robin Fedden and 






Bernard Spencer





. There was also the  group, which produced a magazine and the 
Oasis series of anthologies. To over-simplify, the first group produced poetic reputations, while the second, founded by servicemen, broadcast appeals and collected an archive of 17,000 poems written at the period. 

In fact poets like 






Terence Tiller





 and 
G. S. Fraser had a foot in both camps. 













Keith Douglas












, the iconic 
war poet, was associated with the Personal Landscape group. 
Alan Rook, 







John Gawsworth






 and 

John Waller
 published in Salamander.


Several of the Cairo poets appeared in the 'Poets in Uniform' issue of 
Tambimuttu's 










Poetry London









  early in 1941.


An English literary presence persisted after the war, in the persons of

Old Sow Whirlpool

231752990
2008-08-13T20:27:50Z

LonelyBeacon

Charlotte County, New Brunswick
Whirlpools
Geography of New Brunswick




Old Sow is the name of the largest 
tidal 
whirlpool in the 
Western Hemisphere located off the southwestern shore of 
Deer Island, 

New Brunswick
, 

Canada
 between that island and Moose Island, the principal island of 

Eastport
, 





Maine




.

According to popular etymology the name  Old Sow  is derived from  
pig-like  noises the whirlpool makes when churning; however, a more likely origin is the word  sough  (pronounced  suff ), defined as a  drain,  or a  sucking sound.  Early settlers to the area may easily have mispronounced  sough,  as  sow,  due to its similar spelling to other words with  sow-sound  endings, such as  plough. 


The whirlpool is caused by local 
bathymetry and extreme tidal range where waters exchange between 


Passamaquoddy Bay

 and the 


Bay of Fundy

, combined with the unusual 
topography of the location's sea floor at the confluence of the numerous local currents.


The whirlpools form in an area with a diameter of approximately 250 feet/75 metres, as determined by the president of the Old Sow Whirlpool Survivors' Association in 1995 by way of an aerial photograph. The photograph was calibrated using the Deer Island Point light beacon tower of known width that was included in the photograph.


Old Sow is one of five significant whirlpools worldwide (



Corryvreckan


, 

Scotland
; 





Saltstraumen




, 



Norway


; 
Moskstraumen, 



Norway


; and 
Naruto, 
Japan are the others). Although the tidal currents within Western Passage surrounding Old Sow compare with faster whirlpools elsewhere, the speed of Old Sow's vortex is considerably slower than 
Moskstraumen, the world's most powerful whirlpool.


Tremendous water turbulence occurs locally in the greater Old Sow area, but it does not usually constitute a navigation hazard for motorized vessels with experienced operators at the helm; however, small craft -- especially vessels with keels (sailboats) and human-powered vessels --  are warned to avoid these waters when the tide is running.


Besides Old Sow and its numerous  piglets  (small and medium whirlpools surrounding Old Sow), other area phenomena include standing waves, upwellings (that on rare occasion may even spout several feet into the air), and 10-to-17-feet-deep or more, non-vortexing depressions in the water.


The failed 
Passamaquoddy Tidal Power Project/ Quoddy Dam  Project saw a series of tidal dikes constructed during the 1930s to connect 


Moose Island (Eastport, Maine)

 to Carlow Island (in Eastport), Carlow Island to 









Pleasant Point








 and to connect Treat Island (in Eastport) with Dudley Island (in Lubec, Maine). The changes in local water flow from the dikes reportedly reduced predictability of the  funnel  effect of Old Sow.

Results and competitors by event










Athletics








All eight medals that Trinidad and Tobago had won in the Olympics since 1964 came in Athletics, and even though team star 







Ato Boldon






 had not run a sub 10-second 100 metres since the 








2001 World Championships







, the men's relay team's silver medal at the 








2003 Pan Am Games







 was heartening, as teams from the Americas had swept the podium in Atlanta and Sydney. 


Only two of the individual runners made it to the second round, and none made a final. Two field athletes, 
Cleopatra Borel and 

Candice Scott
 made the first part of their finals, but could not move into the top 8 to earn the three extra attempts in the second half of the final. The men's relay team did make the final, and was again the second placed team from the Americas, but five teams from other continents finished ahead of them.

Swimming




No athlete from the Caribbean had ever won a medal in Swimming, but Trinidad's 

George Bovell
 entered the Athens games with the potential to change that. Bovell was a double gold medalist at the 








2003 Pan American Games







, finished fifth in the 200 metre IM at the 
2003 Worlds, and was the short course world record holder in the 200 metre IM1. Bovell lived up to these expectations, handily qualifying for the 200 metre IM final, and holding off Hungary's 
Laszlo Cseh by just 0.04 seconds to secure a bronze medal. The race for medals behind 

Michael Phelps
 was so close that Bovell was also just 0.02 seconds away from a silver medal.

Raya Dunayevskaya (
1 May 
1910   
9 June 
1987) was the founder of the 
philosophy of 
Marxist Humanism in the 
United States of America.  At one time 


Leon Trotsky

's secretary, she later split with him and ultimately founded the organization 
News and Letters Committees and was its leader until her death.


Biography


Born a 


Jew

 in 

Ukraine
, Dunayevskaya emigrated to the United States and joined the revolutionary movement in her childhood.  Active in the 
American Communist Party youth organization, she was expelled at age 18 and thrown down a flight of stairs when she suggested that her local comrades should find out Trotsky's response to his expulsion from the 
Soviet Communist Party and the 

Comintern
. By the following year she found a group of independent Trotskyists in 
Boston, led by 
Antoinette Buchholz Konikow, an advocate of 
birth control and legal 
abortion.1 


Without getting permission from the U.S. Trotskyist organization, she went to 








Mexico







 in 1937 to serve as 


Leon Trotsky

's Russian language secretary during his 
exile there.2 Having returned to Chicago in 1938 after the deaths of her father and brother, she broke with Trotsky in 1939 when he continued to maintain that the 



Soviet Union


 was a  
workers' state  even after the 

Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact
 (also known as the Hitler-Stalin Pact). She opposed any notion that workers should be asked to defend this  workers' state  allied with 

Nazi Germany
 in a 
world war. Along with theorists like 
Tony Cliff and 
C.L.R. James, Dunayevskaya argued that the Soviet Union had become 
state capitalist. Toward the end of her life, she stated that what she called  my real development  only began after her break with Trotsky.3


Her simultaneous study of the Russian economy and of Marx's early writings (later known as the 
Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844), led to her theory that not only was the 
U.S.S.R. a 
state capitalist society, but that 
state capitalism was a new world stage.  Much of her initial analysis was published in The New International in 1942-1943.


In 1940, she took part in the split in the 
Socialist Workers Party that led to the formation of the 
Workers Party (WP), with whom she shared an objection to Trotsky's characterisation of the Soviet Union as a 
degenerated workers' state. Within the WP, she formed the 





Johnson-Forest Tendency




 alongside 














C. L. R. James













 (she being  Freddie Forest  and he  J.R. Johnson , named for their party cadre names). The tendency argued that the Soviet Union was 
state capitalist, while the WP majority maintained that it was 
bureaucratic collectivist.


Differences within the WP steadily widened, and in 1947, after a brief period of independent existence during which they published a series of documents, the tendency returned to the ranks of the SWP. Their membership in the SWP was based on a shared insistence that there was a pre-revolutionary situation just around the corner, and the shared belief that a 
Leninist party must be in place to take advantage of the coming opportunities.


By 1951, with the failure of their shared perspective to materialise, the tendency developed a theory that rejected traditional Leninism and saw the workers as being spontaneously revolutionary. This was borne out for them by the 1949 U.S. miners' strike. In later years, they were to pay close attention to 
automation, especially in the 
automobile industry, which they came to see as paradigmatic of a new stage of 
capitalism. This led to the tendency leaving the SWP again to begin independent work. 


After more than a decade of developing the theory of 
state capitalism, Dunayevskaya deepened her study of the Hegelian 
dialectic, taking on a task the Johnson-Forest Tendency had set itself: exploring 
Hegel's 
Philosophy of Mind.  She discovered in Hegel's 


Absolutes

 a dual movement: a movement from practice that is itself a form of theory and a movement from theory reaching to philosophy. She considered these 1953 letters to be  the philosophic moment  from which the whole development of 
Marxist Humanism flowed. 


In 1954-1955 Dunayevskaya and C.L.R. James split. In 1955, she founded her own organization, 
News and Letters Committees, and a Marxist-Humanist newspaper, 
News   Letters, which remains in publication today. The newspaper covers women's struggles, the liberation of workers, people of colour, gay, lesbian, bisexual and transsexual rights and the disability rights movement, while not separating that coverage from philosophical and theoretical articles.


Dunayevskaya authored what came to be known as her  trilogy of revolution : 
Marxism and Freedom (1958), 
Philosophy and Revolution (1973), and 
Rosa Luxemburg, Women's Liberation, and Marx's Philosophy of Revolution (1982).  In addition, she selected and introduced a collection of writings, published in 1985, titled Women's Liberation and the Dialectics of Revolution. 


In the last year of her life she was working on a new book which she had tentatively titled, Dialectics of Organization and Philosophy: The 'Party' and Forms of Organization Born Out of Spontaneity. 4


Raya Dunayevskaya's speeches, letters, publications, notes, recordings and other items are located in the Walter P. Reuther Library at 

Wayne State University
 in 
Detroit. Microfilm copies of the collection are available from the WSU Archives of Labor and Urban Affairs. Guides to the collection are available from News and Letters Committees.




Works



Marxism and Freedom: from 1776 Until Today''



Published in 1958, this is the first expression in book form of Raya Dunayevskaya's Marxist Humanism.  A central theme of Marxism and Freedom is Dunayevskaya's assertion that the  movement from  practice is itself a form of theory.  This concept was developed by Dunayevskaya from a direct encounter with Hegel's dialectical philosophy and  particularly 
his 


Absolute

s, which she interpreted as posing a dual movement from 
practice to 
theory, and from theory to practice.  Blacks, workers, women, and youth struggling for freedom were not faceless masses to be led, she held, but the source of new stages of 
cognition because in their very actions was embedded a theory of human 
liberation.  One example of this is the West Virginia Miners General Strike of 1949-1950, where Dunayevskaya pointed out that instead of merely demanding higher wages, the workers were asking questions such as,  What kind of labor should man do?  and  Why should there be such a gulf between thinking and doing?   She based the book's structure on her view that history and theory emanate from the movement from practice. 


The book aimed to  establish the theory of 
















Marxism















 on native grounds.   The 











Montgomery Bus Boycott










, the 
Abolitionist movement, the 

American Civil War
, and the fight for the 
eight-hour day by American workers, and were seen by her as revolutionary American struggles  which provided fertile ground for the 
Humanism of 
Marx. Dunayevskaya 
analyzed the latter struggles as making  historic contributions  to Marx's thinking, especially in the structure and content of his major theoretical work 






Capital





.  The new stage of 
Automation in production--whether in the mines with the  continuous miner  (a machine the miners called a  mankiller ) or in the auto shops--with its consequent speed-up, was also seen by Dunayevskaya as a new stage in American worker revolt. 


The 1958 edition of Marxism and Freedom contained the first published English translations of Karl Marx's 
Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844 and of 
Lenin's notebooks on Hegel's 
Science of Logic.  She felt a false division had been made between the  
young Marx  of 1844, and the  
mature Marx  of Capital. Rather, she saw Marx's complete body of work as a development of 1844, where he broke with bourgeois society and labeled his own thought  a thoroughgoing 


Naturalism

, or 
Humanism.   


Among those who argued for separating Marx into two distinct thinkers--one young and idealistic and the other mature and scientific--were  



Soviet Union


 theoreticians.  Dunayevskaya believed the 




Communist state



 turned Marxism into its opposite--the 
totalitarian theory and practice of 
Stalinist and post-
Stalin USSR--and signaled a new stage of world 

state-capitalism.  Marxism and Freedom presented an analysis of the USSR's economy as state-capitalist--rather than 
socialist, 
bureaucratic collectivist, or a 
Degenerated workers' state--based on Marx's economic categories and official Soviet statistics.  She pointed to the 









Uprising of 1953 in East Germany








 and the 
1956 Hungarian Revolution 
as more than revolts against Communism, because they based themselves on Marx's Humanism.  Later editions added critical analyses of 


Mao Zedong

 and his 
Cultural Revolution. 


Marxist intellectual and

Herbert Marcuse

Quotes





  He who glorifies theory and genius but fails to recognize the limits of a theoretical work, fails likewise to recognize the indispensability of the theoretician.  All of history is the history of the struggle for freedom.  If, as a theoretician, one's ears are attuned to the new impulse from the workers, new  categories  will be created, a new way of thinking, a new step forward in philosophic cognition.   from Marxism and Freedom''







  Precisely where Hegel sounds most abstract, seems to close the shutters tight against the whole movement of history, there he lets the lifeblood of the dialectic   absolute negativity   pour in.  It is true Hegel writes as if the resolution of opposing live forces can be overcome by a mere thought transcendence.  But he has, by bringing oppositions to their most logical extreme, opened new paths, a new relationship of theory to practice, which Marx worked out as a totally new relationship of philosophy to revolution.   Today's revolutionaries turn their backs on this at their peril.   from Philosophy and Revolution''







  It is true that other post-Marx Marxists have rested on a truncated Marxism; it is equally true that no other generation could have seen the problematic of our age, much less solve our problems.  Only live human beings can recreate the revolutionary dialectic forever anew.  And these live human beings must do so in theory as well as in practice.  It is not a question only of meeting the challenge from practice, but of being able to meet the challenge from the self-development of the Idea, and of deepening theory to the point where it reaches Marx's concept of the philosophy of 'revolution in permanence.'   from Rosa Luxemburg, Women's Liberation, and Marx's Philosophy of Revolution''

A glass copy of the Dresden Green Diamond



The 

Dresden
 Green diamond is a 41 


carat

 (8.2 g) natural green 
diamond that has a historical record dating to 
1722, when a London news-sheet carried an article about it in its 
25 October-27th edition. 

It is named after the capital of 






Saxony





, 

Germany
 where it has been on display for most of the last two centuries. It did make some sojourns following 







World War II






, to the 



Soviet Union


 until 
1958, and to the 
Smithsonian in 
Washington DC, 
USA in 
2000, where it was displayed in the same room as the 
Hope diamond.


The stone's unique green color is due to natural exposure to radioactive materials (see 
Diamond enhancement#Irradiation). The stone is being used to compare natural versus lab-produced green diamonds   it is hoped that it can be used to devise a test to differentiate between naturally green diamonds, which are quite rare, and lab-produced ones.


This diamond is located in the 
Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden  
The New Green Vault

Zulu language





KwaZulu was a 
bantustan in 

South Africa
, intended by the 
apartheid government as a semi-independent homeland for the 

Zulu
 people.  The capital, formerly at 
Nongoma, was moved in 1980 to 
Ulundi.


It was led by Chief 







Mangosuthu Buthelezi






 of the 

Zulu
 tribe and head of the 

Inkatha Freedom Party
 until its abolition in 1994.  It was then merged with the surrounding South African province of 





Natal




 to form the new province of 





KwaZulu-Natal




.

Topology




In 
mathematics, in the study in 
topology of 
open covers of a 
topological space X, a star refinement is a particular kind of 
refinement of an open cover of X. Given x in X and an open cover {Wj}
of X, with 
index set J consider then the union W*(x) (called the star of x) of these of the sets Wj for which x is in Wj. An open cover {Wj} is a star refinement of the {Ui} if
for each x in X the set W*(x) is contained in a Ui, for some i (star condition).

Firearm components




A Hellfire trigger is a device that allows a 
semi-automatic firearm to fire at a rate approaching that of fully 
automatic firearms. When the trigger is pressed, the Hellfire device disengages the 
trigger return spring, which moves the operator's trigger finger. As a result, the operator can move his finger to fire individual shots more quickly. Some users may use the Hellfire device in conjunction with 
bump firing techniques to fire more rapidly.

The device is simple, but unsafe and inefficient. Many users complain about the awkward firing position required to shoot a Hellfire trigger-equipped firearm. Use of the trigger may damage a gun or cause it to malfunction, since most semi-automatic firearms are not designed to handle the stress of rapid fire.

Scientific classification










Domain:

 
Eukaryota





















Phylum:

 
Amoebozoa

















Class:

 
Archamoebae













































Genus:

PelomyxaGreef 1874


























































Pelomyxa are giant 
amoebae, usually 500-800 
 m but occasionally up to 5 mm in length.  The most notable species is P. palustris; other described species may be synonyms, or have been moved to the unrelated genus 
Chaos.  They are found in mud at the bottom of freshwater streams.


Pelomyxa have anywhere from two to several hundred 
nuclei.  A moving cell is cylindrical in shape, with a single hemispherical 
pseudopod at the front and a semipermanent projection called a uroid at the back, which is covered in tiny non-motile 
flagella.  They consume a wide variety of food, and have many 
vacuoles containing whatever particles that happen across, both food such as 
diatoms and debris such as sand.


This is one of several genera of amoebae that lack 
mitochondria.  As such it has been considered as possibly one of the most primitive 
eukaryotes, and given its own phylum (Pelobionta or Caryoblastea).  However the absence is now known to be secondary.  It is grouped with the other amitochondriate genera as the 
Archamoebae, which are now placed among the 
Amoebozoa.

Hired! is a 



1940


 
short film that was made by the 









Jam Handy








 
production house for 

Chevrolet
 as a training film for sales managers.  It was shown in two parts during 

Mystery Science Theater 3000
 episodes #423 ( 

Bride of the Monster
 ) and #424 (  ).


Plot


In the movie, Mr. Warren a sales manager at a Chevrolet 
automobile dealership-is talking to his father about the men he hired.  He complains that Jimmy and Henderson are not working out very well as salesmen.  Warren's father tells him that he didn't do much better in the beginning when Harry hired him that he made all kinds of mistakes.  Warren remembers how closely Harry worked with him, and stressed to him the importance of prospects.  His father asks if he has done that for the men working for him.  Warren responds that he was too busy, and his father tells him that Harry wasn't too busy to help him out at first.  Warren thought that Harry helped him because of Harry's friendship with his father, but his father says that Harry helped everyone who came to work for him.


Warren's father swats at insects while talking to his son, but these insects are not visible to the viewer.  The father responds to the insect attack by taking a 
handkerchief from his pocket and draping it over his head. (In the MST3K version, Joel and the bots joke about him swatting at  flying elves .)


Warren realizes that he hasn't done a very good job of helping his men, and that for them to improve he will have to work closely with his staff.  He begins working with each of his men much more closely than he had been Jimmy in particular.  Warren passes on the lessons he learned over the years, and soon finds that his men are doing much better selling cars.




Lessons


At the end of the film, Warren presented the lessons he learned to the viewers:



  First   Hire good men and then see they are well trained on their own product and on competitive products. 


  Second   Be sure they have all the equipment and selling helps they need, and know how to use them. 


  Third   Help them plan their work to make the most effective use of their time. 


  Fourth   Stay in close touch with every man.  Know what each one is doing.  Work with them. 


  Fifth   Keep up their enthusiasm.  Encourage every man every day. 


Finally he tells viewers that those they hired need the help of their managers.

Executive Council of Alberta
Alberta government departments and agencies




The Executive Council of Alberta (informally and more commonly, the Cabinet of Alberta) is the 







cabinet






 of 

that Canadian province
.

Almost always made up of members of the 

Legislative Assembly of Alberta
, the Cabinet is similar in structure and role to the 







Cabinet of Canada






 while being smaller in size. As federal and provincial responsibilities differ there are a number of different portfolios between the federal and provincial governments.


The 
Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta, as representative of the 

Queen in Right of Alberta
, heads the council, and is referred to as the 
Governor-in-Council. Other members of the Cabinet, who advise, or 





minister




, the vice-regal, are selected by the 

Premier of Alberta
 and appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor. Most cabinet ministers are the head of a 
ministry, but this is not always the case.


As at the federal level the most important Cabinet post after that of the leader is Minister of Finance. Today the next most powerful position is certainly the health portfolio which has a vast budget and is of central political import. Other powerful portfolios include Education and Energy.



Current Cabinet


The current ministry has been in place since 
March 12, 
2008 following the 2008 election.
Members are listed in 
order of precedence.

Ministries


In Alberta, the ministries' names have two forms, often coexisting. The usual one is  Alberta X , (e.g. 
Alberta Education) the older style is  Ministry of X  (e.g. 
Ministry of Finance). The newer style without the word  ministry  resembles the federal government's 


Federal Identity Program

 and the federal naming scheme, except in reverse order. Federal ministries and departments are usually  X Canada  (e.g. 

Environment Canada
).


With every new cabinet ministries can be created or disbanded, renamed or gain or loose responsibilities. Some ministries such as finance or health are common to all provincial governments and are comparable to similar ministries or departments at the federal level or indeed even in other countries. However, some ministries are quite distinct to Alberta, such as the Ministry of Sustainable Resource Development which oversees the management of public lands.


These are the current ministries 
as of 2008, listed alphabetically, with a short description and any notes to changes to that ministry's mandate.

Diagram showing how 


















D. B. Cooper

















 left the hijacked airplane; now, the Cooper vane makes this impossible.



A Cooper vane (also sometimes called a  D. B. Cooper switch ) is a mechanical 
aerodynamic 
wedge that prevents the 
airstair or rear stairway of an aircraft from being lowered in flight.1  Following three 















hijackings














 in 
1972, 

Boeing 727
 aircraft were ordered by the 

Federal Aviation Administration
 to be fitted with Cooper vanes.2 The device was named for famed airplane hijacker 


















D. B. Cooper

















, who used the rear stairway to exit a plane in flight and make his escape via 
parachute.

The Cooper vane is a very simple device consisting of a spring-loaded paddle connected to a plate. When the aircraft is on the 
tarmac, the spring keeps the paddle perpendicular to the 
fuselage, and the attached plate does not block the stairway. As the aircraft takes off, the airflow pushes the paddle parallel to the fuselage and the plate is moved underneath the stairway, preventing it from being lowered.  Once the airflow decreases on landing, the spring-loaded paddle returns to its initial position, thereby allowing the stairs to be lowered again. Although this device was intended to prevent hijackings aboard the 727 and other aircraft with an airstair, many airlines sealed the 
airstair entirely, never to use it again.

The 
Pacific island nation 

Nauru
 (NRU) competed at the 
Summer Olympic Games first in the 



1996 games


 in 
Atlanta. The country has made repeat appearances in 

Sydney
 in 



2000


 and in 
















Athens















 in 



2004


. 


The nation is mainly known for its weightlifting tradition and all seven athletes that have competed for Nauru at the Olympics have been weightlifters.


Nauru earns a distinction for being the smallest nation in the 2002 member 

International Olympic Committee
.


Under the leadership of the Hon. Vinson Detenamo, the Olympic movement began in Nauru in the early 1990s. The Olympic Committee was established in 
1991 and talks with the 

International Olympic Committee
 started the same year. In May 
1994 Nauru presented its bid to join the IOC and in September 1994 the nation was accepted, clearing the path for participation in the 1996 games. 


1996 was not the first time that Nauru athletes participated in the Olympics.  After his sensational win in the 





1990 Commonwealth Games




, weightlifter 

Marcus Stephen
 petitioned for citizenship in 

Samoa
 to compete in the 
1992 games. Stephen again competed at the Olympics in 1996 and 2000, now for his native country. He placed 11th in the 62 kg category in 2000. 



Paul Coffa is the weightlifting coach of the Oceania Weightlifting Federation and has been Nauru's Olympic coach since 1994.

Steve Cannane is a news journalist and current affairs reporter for the 

Triple J
, the 

Australia
n national youth government-funded Australian radio station (a division of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation).

current affairs show.  In 
2003, after

 left the station, Cannane took on the position of host of the show. 

This role only lasted a year after a shake-up at Triple J caused a shuffle of their programming. In this shake up Triple J's current affairs show changed format.  The three hour Morning Show, which featured talkback and pre-recorded journalism intermixed with music from Triple J's playlists was replaced in 
2004 with a half-hour program named 






Hack





. The new show, which broadcasted from 5:30pm on weekdays was completely music free and dedicated to news, current affairs and similar pieces of radio journalism and talkback. After two and a half years as the host of Hack, Steve Cannane's last show was on 
July 7 
2006. Steve is currently working on 
jtv.


Steve won the 2006 



Walkley Award for Broadcast Interviewing


 for his Hack stories on  Petrol Sniffing, Pill Testing and the Cost of War .

National Wildlife Refuges in Kansas
Recreational areas in Kansas
Linn County, Kansas




Marais des Cygnes National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) is located 39 miles (63 km) south of the 

Kansas City
 metropolitan area, along the 
Marais des Cygnes River in 

Linn County
. The 7,500 acre (30 km ) 



Refuge


 was established in 
1992 to protect one of the northwestern-most examples of bottomland 
hardwood forest in the 








United States







 as well as the largest contiguous tract of bottomland hardwood forest in 





Kansas




.  'Marais des Cygnes' means '
Marsh of 
Swans' in 

French
.

High quality stands of bottomland hardwood forest, upland 
oak-
hickory forest, 
tallgrass prairie, seasonal and permanent 
wetlands, and 
riverine areas are found throughout the Refuge. These unique areas harbor many species that are considered nationally or regionally threatened such as 
bald eagles, 
peregrine falcons, 
cerulean warblers, 
broadhead skinks, 
flat floater mussels, and 
Mead's milkweed. 


More than 30 species of 
warblers migrate through or nest on the Refuge. The Refuge also is known to harbor 30 species of 
mussels. Other interesting species are 
river otters, 
bobcats, 
paddlefish, 
crawfish frogs, 
scissor-tailed flycatchers, 
loggerhead shrike, and 
red-shouldered hawks. The Refuge provides a rare opportunity to view high quality examples of a number of uncommon plant and animal communities all within a short distance of each other. Some of these communities are rare throughout North America, including bottomland hardwood forest, which has been reduced by 80% nationally, and tallgrass prairie, which has been reduced by 99% nationally.

A modern day chapbook.



Chapbook is a generic term to cover a particular genre of pocket-sized booklet, popular from the sixteenth through to the later part of the nineteenth century. No exact definition can be applied. Chapbook can mean anything that would have formed part of the stock of 
chapmen, a variety of 
pedlar. The word chapman probably comes from the Anglo-Saxon word for barter, buy and sell.

The term chapbook was formalised by 
bibliophiles of the 
nineteenth century, as a variety of 
ephemera (disposable printed material.) It includes many kinds of printed material, such as 
pamphlets, political and religious 
tracts, 
nursery rhymes, 
poetry, 
folk tales, children's literature and almanacs. Where there were illustrations, they would be 
popular prints. 



History


There are records from 
Cambridgeshire as early as in 
1553 of a man offering a scurrilous ballad  maistres mass  at an alehouse, and a pedlar selling  lytle books  to people, including a patcher of old clothes in 
1578. These sales are probably characteristic of the market for chapbooks.



Broadside ballads were popular songs, sold for a 
penny or 
halfpenny in the streets of towns and villages around Britain between the sixteenth and early twentieth centuries. They preceded chapbooks, but had similar content, marketing and distribution systems. 


Chapbooks gradually disappeared from the mid nineteenth century in the face of competition from cheap newspapers and, especially in Scotland, religious tract societies that regarded them as  ungodly. 


Although the form originated in Britain, many were made in the U.S. during the same period. Chapbooks are published in South America even today.


Because of their flimsy nature such 
ephemera rarely survive as individual items. They were aimed at buyers without formal libraries, and, in an era when paper was expensive, were used for wrapping or baking. Paper has also always had hygienic uses and there are contemporary references to the use of chapbooks as bum fodder (i.e. toilet paper).


Many of the surviving chapbooks come from the collections of 


Samuel Pepys

 between 
1661 and 
1688 which are now held at 





Magdalene College




, 

Cambridge
.  





Anthony Wood




 also collected 65 chapbooks, (including 20 from before 1660), which are now at The 






Bodleian Library





. There are also significant Scottish collections. 


Modern collectors, such as 

Peter Opie
, have chiefly a scholarly interest in the form.




Production and distribution


Chapbooks are mostly small 
paper-covered booklets, usually printed on a single sheet folded into books of 8, 12, 16 and 24 pages, often illustrated with crude 
woodcuts, which sometimes bear no relation to the text. They were produced cheaply. One collector, Harry Weiss, wrote:  the printing in many cases was execrable, the paper even worse, and the woodcut illustrations, some of which did duty for various tales regardless of their fitness, were sometimes worse than the paper and presswork combined . However, the category has no real limits: some chapbooks were long, some well produced, and some even historically accurate. 


The centre of chapbook and ballad production was 

London
, and until the 










Great Fire of London









 the printers were based around 

London Bridge
. However, a feature of chapbooks is the proliferation of provincial printers, especially in Scotland and Newcastle upon Tyne. 




Content


Chapbooks were an important medium for the dissemination of popular culture to the common people, especially in rural areas. They were a medium of entertainment, information and (generally unreliable) history. They are now valued as a record of popular culture, preserving cultural artifacts that may not survive in any other form.


Chapbooks were priced for sales to workers, although their market was not limited to the working classes. Broadside ballads were sold for a 
halfpenny, or a few 
pence. Prices of chapbooks were from 2d. to 6d., when agricultural labourers wages were 12d. per day. It needs to be remembered that in early modern England literacy was not uncommon, and in Scotland probably more so. Many working people were readers, even if not writers, and pre-industrial working patterns provided periods during which they could read. Chapbooks were undoubtedly used for reading to family groups or groups in alehouses.


They even contributed to the development of literacy. 








Francis Kirkman







, the author and publisher, wrote about how they fired his imagination and his love of books. There is other evidence of their use by autodidacts.


Nevertheless, the numbers printed are astonishing. In the 1660s as many as 400,000 
almanacs were printed annually, enough for one family in three in England. One seventeenth century publisher of chapbooks in London had in stock one book for every 15 families in the country. In the 1520s the 

Oxford
 bookseller, John Dorne, noted in his day-book selling up to 190 
ballads a day at a halfpenny each. The probate inventory of the stock of Charles Tias, of The sign of the Three Bibles on London Bridge, in 
1664 included books and printed sheets to make c.90,000 chapbooks (inc. 400 reams of paper) and 37,500 ballad sheets. Tias was not regarded as an outstanding figure in the trade. The inventory of Josiah Blare, of The Sign of the Looking Glass on London Bridge, in 
1707 listed 31,000 books, plus 257 reams of printed sheets. A conservative estimate of their sales in Scotland alone in the second half of the eighteenth century was over 200,000 per year. 


These printers provided chapbooks to 
chapmen on credit, who carried them around the country, selling from door to door, at markets and fairs, and returning to pay for the stock they sold. This facilitated wide distribution and large sales with minimum outlay, and also provided the printers with feedback about what titles were most popular. Popular works were reprinted, pirated, edited, and produced in different editions. 








Francis Kirkman







, whose eye was always on the market, wrote two 
sequels to the popular Don Bellianus of Greece, first printed in 1598.


Publishers also issued catalogues, and chapbooks are found in the libraries of provincial 
yeomen and 
gentry.  John Whiting, a Quaker yeoman imprisoned at 

Ilchester
, 
Somerset in the 1680s had books sent by carrier from London, and left for him at an inn.


Pepys had a collection of ballads bound into volumes, under the following classifications, into which could fit the subject matter of most chapbooks: 



 Devotion and Morality


 History   true and fabulous 


 Tragedy: viz. Murders, executions, and judgements of God


 State and Times


 Love   pleasant


 Ditto   unpleasant


 Marriage, Cuckoldry,  c.


 Sea   love, gallantry   actions


 Drinking and good fellowship


 Humour, frollicks and mixt.




The stories in many of the popular chapbooks can be traced back to much earlier origins. Bevis of Hampton, was an Anglo-Norman romance of thirteenth century, which probably drew on earlier themes. The structure of 
The Seven Sages of Rome was from the orient, and was used by 
Chaucer. Many jests about ignorant and greedy clergy in chapbooks were taken from The Friar and the Boy printed about 
1500 by 






Wynkyn de Worde





, and The Sackfull of News, (
1557). 


Historical stories set in a mythical and fantastical past were popular. The selection is interesting. 



Charles I


, and 


Oliver Cromwell

 do not appear as historical figures in the Pepys collection, and 
Elizabeth I only once. 
The Wars of the Roses and the 





English Civil War




 do not appear at all. 
Henry VIII   



Henry II


 appear in disguise, standing up for the right with cobblers   millers and then inviting them to Court and rewarding them. There was a pattern of high born heroes overcoming reduced circumstances by valour, such as 
St George, 






Guy of Warwick





, 








Robin Hood







 (who at this stage has yet to give to the poor what he was stealing from the rich), and heroes of low birth who achieve status through force of arms, such as Clim of Clough, and William of Cloudesley. Clergy often appear as figures of fun, and stupid countrymen were also popular (e.g., 
The Wise Men of Gotham). Other works were aimed at regional and rural audience (e.g., The Country Mouse and the Town Mouse).


From 
1597 works appeared aimed at specific trades, such as 
clothiers, 
weavers and 
shoemakers. The latter were commonly literate. Thomas Deloney, a weaver, wrote Thomas of 

Reading
, about six clothiers from 

Reading
, 

Gloucester
, 

Worcester
, 

Exeter
, 

Salisbury
   

Southampton
, travelling together and meeting at 

Basingstoke
 their fellows from 

Kendal
, 

Manchester
 and 

Halifax
. In his, Jack of 

Newbury
, 
1600, set in 
Henry VIII's time, an apprentice to a 
broadcloth weaver takes over his business and marries his widow on his death. On achieving success, he is liberal to the poor and refuses a knighthood for his substantial services to the king. 


Other examples from the Pepys collection include The Countryman's Counsellor, or Everyman his own Lawyer, and Sports and Pastimes, written for schoolboys, including magic tricks, like how to  fetch a shilling out of a handkerchief , write invisibly, make roses out of paper, snare wild duck, and make a maid-servant fart uncontrollably.


The provinces and Scotland had their own local heroes. 

Robert Burns
 commented that one of the first two books he read in private was the history of Sir 


William Wallace

 that  poured a Scottish prejudice in my veins which will boil along there till the flood-gates of life shut in eternal rest




Influence


They had a wide and continuing influence. 80% of English 
folk songs collected by early twentieth century collectors have been linked to printed broadsides, including over 90 of which could only be derived from those printed before 1700. It has been suggested the majority of surviving ballads can be traced to 1550-1600 by internal evidence.


One of the most popular and influential chapbooks was Richard Johnson's Seven Champions of Christendom (
1596), believed to be the source for the introduction of the character 
St George into English 
folk plays.









Robert Greene





's novel, Dorastus and Fawnia, (originally Pandosto) (
1588), the basis of Shakespeare's 








The Winter's Tale







 was still being published in cheap editions in the 1680s. Some stories were still being published in the nineteenth century, (e.g., Jack of Newbury, Friar Bacon, Dr Faustus and 
The Seven Champions of Christendom).




Modern chapbooks


Chapbook is also a term currently used to denote low-cost hard copy production, particularly of 
poetry. Poetry chapbooks tend to focus on a specific theme, story, or form to unify the entire book.  


The genre has been revitalized in the past 20 years by the widespread availability of low-cost copy centers and the cultural revolutions spurred by both 
zines and 
poetry slams, the latter generating hundreds upon hundreds of self-published chapbooks that are used to fund tours.

Standby power.
An energy vampire or psychic vampire is a being said to have the ability to feed off the  
life force  (often also called 
qi, 
prana, energy or vitality) of other living creatures. Alternative terms for these persons are pranic vampire, empathic vampire, energy predator (see below), psy/psi-vamp, energy parasite, energivore or psionic vampire.


Legends


The legends and spiritual teachings of some cultures refer to people, often given priestly attributes, who manipulate or remove (feed from) the energy of others. The tiger-women spoken of across 



Asia


 (as well as the 
fox-women of 
Japan) and the 
Jiang Shi of 
China may be noted, as can the 
incubus and 
succubus of 
Judaeo-Christian mythology. This concept is purported to be represented in the 
myths of a number of cultures, just as 
blood-drinking vampires are.


In the oral tradition of the 

Hopi
, a powaqa is a sorcerer who comes to a victim pretending to help and then feeds off the victim's life force (see 

Powaqqatsi
)..




'Modern' interpretations





Literary work on vampirism and predatory spirituality. A modern occultist view on energy vampires.


 








Dion Fortune




 wrote of psychic parasitism in relation to vampirism as early as 1930 (considering it a combination of psychic and psychological pathology) in  Psychic Self-Defense .12 The term  psychic vampire  first gained attention in the 1960s with the publication of 



Anton LaVey's


 
Satanic Bible. LaVey, who claimed to have coined the term,3
used it to mean a 
spiritually or 
emotionally weak person who drains vital energy from other people. Adam Parfrey likewise attributed the term to LaVey in an introduction to 

The Devil's Notebook
.
The term is also used by Luis Marques in his work on vampirism and spirituality, entitled the 
Asetian Bible, where the definition of a psychic vampire goes beyond his ability to drain energy, but is portrayed as a definitive condition of the individual's soul and a secret mark of a connection to a shared past. This polemic view of the energy predator is based on an esoteric tradition known as Asetianism, which relies on predatory spirituality and the extensive use of Ancient Egyptian symbolism, whose teachings are strictly and thoroughly maintained by the occultist Order of Aset Ka.4


The theme of the psychic vampire has been a focus within 
modern Vampire subculture. The way that the subculture has manipulated the image of the psychic vampire has been investigated by researchers such as Mark Benecke5 and A. Asbjorn Jon.6 Jon has noted that, like the traditional psychic vampires, those of Vampyre subculture 'prey[s] upon life-force or 'pranic' energy'.6 Jon also noted that the group has been loosely linked to the Goth subculture. Unfortunately, psychic vampires are forced to feel the emotions of those who they steal energy from, sometimes without consciously doing it. This condition is also called 
empathy.




In popular fiction


Energy vampires are not as common in literature, comics and movies compared to the more traditional vampires, but the concept nonetheless makes an appearance in a number of popular works. The 1968 













Star Trek












 episode 






Day of the Dove





 featured an alien life force that intended to live off the psychic energy of anger by imprisoning 





Klingon




 and 


United Federation of Planets

 combatants forever in violent circumstances. In 

Lifeforce
, a movie from 1985, most of London's population are turned into zombies after their lifeforce has been drained from them by three psychic vampires. The 

















Wraith
















 of the 












Stargate universe











, the Vorvon from the 
Buck Rogers in the 25th Century episode entitled  Space Vampire , and the 

Atavus
 from  feed on the  lifeforce  of humans. 


For an example in video games, see the Metroids from the video game 





Metroid




.


In the anime and manga series 








Sailor Moon







, the 

































Dark Kingdom
































/Negaverse collects the life energy of humans in order to make 
Queen Metallia (
The Negaforce) grow stronger. Also in the Sailor Moon metaseries, characters like Queen Badiane also collect the energy of humans.


The White Court Vampires in 


Jim Butcher

's 

Dresden novels
 are another example.


In 





World of Warcraft




, the Nathrezim (Dreadlords) are vampyric in nature, draining Life Energy from their victims and devouring their souls (
Dreadlord).

Philip K. Dick

 also wrote a short story about the subject in 






The Cookie Lady





, where a young boy is drained of his youth and energy by an old woman.


Several of 



Stephen King


's villains are energy or empathetic vampires: 





Pennywise




 from 





It




, 
Dandelo from 
The Dark Tower series, 
Tak from 





The Regulators




 and 
Desperation, and Ardelia Lortz from the short story 'The Library Policeman' from 

Four Past Midnight
. The concept also appears in 

Sleepwalkers
, a 1992 film based on an unpublished novel by King.



L. J. Smith has a 
young adult fiction trilogy called 





Dark Visions




 which deals with energy vampires (called psychic vampires in the work).  In this story, special crystals can store psychic energy.  Contact with an impure one will increase psychic powers but will have the side effect of increasing one's life energy metabolism, causing the person to become an energy vampire.  In the story, the energy vampires may acquire their needed energy from either a person, or one of the special crystals.


In an episode of , the Master Cho character takes a small amount of life force from people so he can have energy.


In an episode of , a villain named Mike Morningstar drains unsuspecting girls of their energy, turning them into zombie slaves that follow his orders, collecting more energy to give to the villain. Gwen, who nearly becomes a zombie slave herself, comes to her senses and gets her energy back, prompting the other zombie girls to do the same, reducing Mike into an aged, withered man in the process. The 

Ben 10
 villain Zombozo the Clown is also an energy vampire, creating a machine called the Psyclown to drain the  positive energy  from his audiences order to have energy for himself.


In an episode of 

Teen Titans
, a villain named 
Mother Mae-Eye drains her victims (mostly referred to by her as her  children ,  sweeties  and  little ones ) of their love, which (like the energy of the 








Sailor Moon







 anime and manga series) appears as a mist. 












Starfire











 later figures out her plan; Mother feeds on the  sweet, nourishing affection  of her children in order to have strength.


In the 1993 film entitled 

Hocus Pocus
, the Sanderson Sisters used a magic witch's potion to suck the life force from little children.


The Book of Lost Things by John Connelly has a sinister villain known as the Crooked Man, whose strange powers and unnatural body are kept alive in his parallel world by convincing children in our world to betray another child, who he takes to his world and feeds on their energy for however long they would have lived.


In the manga/anime series 
Descendants of Darkness, the antagonist, Muraki, is said to be an energy-vampire.

Prime Ministers of Finland
Finnish politicians
1980 deaths




Keijo Antero Liinamaa (
6 April 
1929   
28 June 
1980) was a lawyer and 
caretaker 


Prime Minister of Finland

.

Liinamaa, a 
lawyer specialised in 
labour law, began his career working for the Finnish Central Union of Trade Unions (
SAK). In 1958, at only 29 years of age, he became the town manager of 
Mantta, an industrial 
municipality in 





Western Finland




. Upon the creation of a nation-wide labour dispute 
conciliation mechanism in the early 1960s, Liinamaa was appointed a regional labour dispute conciliator.  In 1965 he became the National Labour Dispute Conciliator.


In 1965 1967 due to turbulent economic winds, Liinamaa was faced with conciling dozens of labour disputes. In his capacity as the National Conciliator, he was able to prevent several major 
strikes.


In 1967 Liinamaa was given a special task by 
Prime Minister 





Rafael Paasio




: Liinamaa was to negotiate a comprehensive economical deal with employers' organisations and labour unions in order to prevent inflation due to rising wages. These negotiations resulted in the first 



Comprehensive Income Policy Agreement


 and brought fame to Liinamaa.


Radical changes in support of 
political parties in the 


parliamentary elections

 of 1970 lead to severe political conflicts: no political coalition could be established to form a 
cabinet. 
President 


Urho Kekkonen

 appointed a caretaker cabinet headed by 








Teuvo Aura







. Under Prime Minister Aura, Liinamaa served as the 
Justice Minister for sixty-three days in May July 1970 until a new coalition government was formed by 










Ahti Karjalainen









.


Karjalainen's coalition fell in the autumn of 1971 and early parliamentary elections were called. A second caretaker cabinet led by Teuvo Aura was appointed, where Liinamaa served as Minister of Labour from October 1971 to February 1972.


Following the election of 1975, the political parties couldn't agree on terms for a coalition government. President Kekkonen appointed Keijo Liinamaa as Prime Minister of a caretaker government that lasted from June till November 1975. Kekkonen's intervention made possible the formation of a new coalition government under 










Martti Miettunen









 in the autumn of 1975.

The Humanx Commonwealth is a fictional interstellar ethical/political entity featured in the 
science fiction novels of 



Alan Dean Foster


.12 The Commonwealth takes its name from its two major 
sapient species, who jointly inhabit Commonwealth planets and administer both the political and religious/ethical aspects. They are the 
mammalian Humans of the planet 
Earth and the 
insectoid 
Thranx which dwell upon 



Hivehom


.  The Commonwealth is described as a progressive, well-intentioned 
liberal democracy spanning many star systems, and is somewhat similar to the 


United Federation of Planets

 from 













Star Trek












.  The Humanx Commonwealth is notable for its portrayal of a human-alien relationship that is not just mutually beneficial but actually makes both species better.

Priests in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints



Young men who reach the age of 16 are integrated into the Priests 
Quorum. Those who are deemed worthy and interviewed by the bishop are ordained to the office of a Priest by another Priest or a holder of the 
Melchizedek Priesthood. A Priests Quorum can have a maximum of 48 members, so Priests Quorums are rarely split, even in the largest 
wards.


The president of the Priests Quorum is the 








Bishop







, who holds the keys of the priesthood for this quorum. The Bishop typically calls a first assistant and a second assistant and a secretary from among the members of the quorum. The Bishop's assistants in the Priests Quorum are not the first and second counselors that serve in the bishopric. Generally, the first assistant acts as a de facto president of the quorum, but seeks approval from the Bishop in everything he does.


According to 
scripture, the duty of a Priest is to  preach, teach, expound, exhort, and baptize, and administer the sacrament .1 Accordingly, Priests bless the 
sacrament and are permitted to perform the ordinance of 
baptism. They also are able to ordain 
Deacons, 
Teachers, and Priests and confer the 
Aaronic Priesthood upon others. Usually, a Priest will be paired with an adult male (often their father) as a 
Home Teacher. They perform all of these functions under the direction of the Bishop, who holds the  priesthood keys  of this office. Priests also have all the duties and authority of a 





Teacher




 and a 





Deacon




.


The adult president of the local 
Young Men Organization advises the Priests Quorum. Sometimes an assistant advisor is also called.


As the Church in the 








United States







 and 

Canada
 sponsors troops of the 
Boy Scouts of America and 




Scouts Canada



 programs, many Priests participate in these 
Scouting programs as well. The adult ward leaders of the 
Young Men Organization are frequently also leaders in the Scout troop, but the priesthood quorums and the Scouts are not otherwise connected. 


When a Priest turns 18 years old, or graduates from high school, depending on the situation, he is integrated into the 
Elders Quorum. Those that are 18 years old and deemed worthy by the Bishop and Stake President will receive the 
Melchizedek Priesthood and become an 
Elder.


Priests generally spend a great amount of time preparing for their future service as a 
missionary. All worthy and able young men in the Church are asked to serve missions at the age of 19.

Diet Pepsi is a 
low-
calorie 
carbonated 
cola, introduced in 1964 as a variant of 
Pepsi-Cola with no sugar.  Its current formula in the United States contains only the artificial sweetener 
aspartame. The current Canadian formulation contains both aspartame (124mg/355ml) and 
acesulfame potassium (32mg/355ml).  Pepsi does not list on its United States labeling the exact amount of aspartame/Nutrasweet present.


In some countries, Diet Pepsi is known as Pepsi Light.  This is not to be confused with an earlier 








U.S.







 product of the 
same name which was essentially 1970s Diet Pepsi with lemon flavoring.


Although Diet Pepsi contains 
caffeine, another version is available without caffeine. Additional variations of Diet Pepsi have been introduced over the years, wherein other flavors (such as 
wild cherry, 
vanilla, 
lemon, and 
lime) have been added to the cola.  Their availability and brand identification vary by country.


Diet Pepsi's current slogan is  Light.Crisp.Refreshing. 



 Test Marketing 


Diet Pepsi was first introduced as 




Patio



 Diet Cola in 
1963. After the drink received positive reviews, it was re-introduced as Diet Pepsi in 
1964. 
http://www.usasoda.com/pepsidiet1.htm




Marketing


In the 








United States







 Diet Pepsi is marketed as calorie-free, as 
FDA guidelines allow products with less than five calories per serving to be labeled as containing zero calories 
http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/14mar20010800/edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2002/aprqtr/21cfr101.9.htm. 



PepsiCo also markets low-calorie colas known as 

Pepsi Max
 and 

Pepsi ONE
.


When Diet Pepsi was introduced, it originally contained one calorie (just like 

Pepsi ONE
) until the late 90's. Then it was marked to having zero calories.




Advertising


In 1985, immediately following 






Super Bowl XIX





, the game's respective quarterbacks, 

Joe Montana
 and 























Dan Marino






















, meet in a hallway of what appears to be a football stadium. Montana of the winning team, buys Marino a Diet Pepsi, and Marino promises to buy the drink the next year.


During the early-1990s, blues singer 






Ray Charles





 was featured in a series of Diet Pepsi ads featuring the brand's then-current 
tagline,  You got the right one, baby! 1


In the United States, Diet Pepsi commercials featured a Diet Pepsi 
vending machine (simply called Machine) being 
drafted into the 
NFL by the 









New England Patriots








.2 The machine cannot be tackled because of its size compared to the human players, therefore leading to many 
touchdown catches as a 
wide receiver.  In a more recent commercial, Machine now plays for the 









New Orleans Saints








, competing with running back 





Reggie Bush




.3


Other commercials have featured Diet Pepsi (the can) as an entertainer represented by  agent  


Jay Mohr

, appearing in a music video produced by 






Diddy





 ( Brown and Bubbly )4 and in an action film featuring 



Jackie Chan


 (in which a rival 

Diet Coke
 can serves as an oft-abused  
stunt double ).5 Diet Pepsi (the can) has also been portrayed as a great 
poker player, winning hand after hand against champions 

Daniel Negreanu
, 

Phil Hellmuth
, and 

Scotty Nguyen
.


In an instance of 
product placement, a futuristic Diet Pepsi bottle can be seen in the background of  Cafe '80s  in

Health concerns



Diet Pepsi contains the 
artificial sweetener 
aspartame, which has been the subject of a vigorous 







public controversy






 regarding its safety and the circumstances around its approval. A few studies have recommended further investigation into the possible connection between aspartame and diseases such as 
brain tumors, 
brain lesions, and 
lymphoma.789 These findings, combined with alleged 
conflicts of interest in the approval process, have engendered vocal activism regarding the possible risks of aspartame.10


Diet Pepsi is acidic; drinking acidic drinks over a long period of time can 
erode the 
tooth enamel, particularly when they are sipped throughout the day rather than consumed with food. Drinking through a straw is often advised by 
dentists as the drink is then swallowed from the back of the mouth and does not come into contact with the teeth. It has also been suggested that 
brushing teeth right after drinking soft drinks should be avoided as this can result in additional erosion to the teeth due to the presence of acid.11



Caffeine and 
phosphoric acid may also be concerns; see 
soft drink controversy. Diet Pepsi is not good for people that have heart problems or have a family history of it.


Diet Pepsi does not contain 
ascorbic acid or 
erythorbic acid, so 
benzene levels do not appear to be a significant concern.

The Triangle of Life is a controversial theory advocated by 
Doug Copp about how to survive a major 
earthquake. It is intended to replace the traditional  drop, cover, and hold on  tactic. Copp recommends that, at the onset of a major earthquake, building occupants should seek 
shelter near solid items that will provide a protective space, a void or space that could prevent 
injury or permit survival in the event of a major structural failure -- a  
pancake collapse . Such failures are rare in western communities where opponents argue the drop, cover and hold on tactic will prevent the vast majority of gravity-induced injuries that occur more frequently.1 

As described in the links below, Copp's assertions that he has seen people who died from not using his method are not corroborated, and Copp's beliefs are not supported by independent sources. His criticism does call attention to the need to follow the most current authoritative advice, as detailed below. Part of the issue is determining the extent of the danger in any earthquake. Copp's  triangle of life  recognizes that the weight of falling items may be great enough to crush objects like table legs or non weight-bearing partitions, but not so great as to completely crush more substantial partitions or nearby structural items.


A number of claims Copp has made about his experience as a rescue worker have been called into question.2

In 1996, Copp made a film to prove this methodology. He recreated a model school and home, filling them with 20 
mannequins. He collapsed the buildings, with half the mannequins in 'duck and cover' position and the others in what Copp calls the 'triangle of life' position. When buildings collapse, the weight of the ceilings falling upon the objects or furniture inside tends to crush them, but the height of the object that remains acts as a kind of roof beam over the space or void next to it, which will tend to end up with a sloping roof over it. This space for survival Copp terms the triangle of life. The larger and stronger the object, the less it will compact; the less it compacts, the larger the void next to it will be. Such triangles are the most common shape to be found in a collapsed building. When Copp and his crew re-entered the simulated earthquake scenario after the blast, they calculated that there would have been no survivors amongst the mannequins in 'duck and cover' positions, as against 100% survival for those hiding in the triangles beside solid objects. Copp is categorical about the importance of this technique: Everyone who simply ducks and covers when buildings collapse is crushed to death - every time without exception. 


However, according to the scientific community Copp's statement may, even when interpreted most liberally, only be considered for pancake-type collapses, which are rare in the 
developed world.

Shen Kuo  


Hanlin Academy







This is a 
Chinese name; the 
family name is Shen.

Shen Kuo or Shen Kua (

Chinese
:   ; 
pinyin: Sh n Kuo; 
Wade-Giles: Shen K'uo) (1031 1095), 
style name Cunzhong and 
pseudonym Mengqi Weng,1 was a 
polymathic 
Chinese 
scientist and statesman of the 

Song Dynasty
 (960 1279). Excelling in many fields of study and statecraft, he was a 
mathematician, 
astronomer, 
meteorologist, 
geologist, 
zoologist, 
botanist, 



pharmacologist


, 
agronomist, 
archaeologist, 
ethnographer, 
cartographer, 
encyclopedist, 
general, 
diplomat, 
hydraulic engineer, 
inventor, 
academy chancellor, 
finance minister, governmental state inspector, 
poet, and 
musician. He was the head official for the 
Bureau of Astronomy in the Song court, as well as an Assistant Minister of Imperial Hospitality.2 At court his political allegiance was to the Reformist faction known as the 
New Policies Group, headed by 



Chancellor


 










Wang Anshi









 (1021 1086).


In his 








Dream Pool Essays







 (    ; Mengxi Bitan) of 1088, Shen was the first to describe the magnetic needle 
compass, which would be used for navigation (first described in Europe by 

Alexander Neckam
 in 1187).34 Shen discovered the concept of 
true north in terms of 
magnetic declination towards the 
north pole,4 with experimentation of suspended magnetic needles and  the improved 
meridian determined by Shen s [astronomical] measurement of the distance between the 
polestar and true north .5 This was the decisive step in human history to make compasses more useful for navigation, and may have been a concept unknown in Europe 
for another four hundred years (evidence of German sundials made circa 1450 show markings similar to Chinese geomancer compasses in regards to declination).67 


Alongside his colleague 








Wei Pu







, Shen accurately mapped the orbital paths of the moon and the planets, in an intensive five-year project that rivaled the later work of the 

Danish
 astronomer 

Tycho Brahe
 (1546 1601). To aid his work in astronomy, Shen Kuo made improved designs of the 
armillary sphere, 
gnomon, sighting tube, and invented a new type of inflow 
water clock. Shen Kuo devised a 
geological hypothesis for land formation (
geomorphology), based upon findings of inland 
marine 
fossils, knowledge of 
soil erosion, and the 
deposition of 
silt.8 He also proposed a hypothesis of gradual 
climate change, after observing ancient 
petrified 
bamboos that were preserved underground in a dry northern habitat that would not support bamboo growth in his time. He was the first literary figure in China to mention the use of the 
drydock to repair boats suspended out of water, and also wrote of the effectiveness of the relatively new invention of the canal 
pound lock. Although 

Ibn al-Haytham
 (965 1039) was the first to describe 
camera obscura, Shen was the first in China to do so, several decades later. Shen wrote extensively about 
movable type 
printing invented by 








Bi Sheng







 (990 1051), and because of his written works the legacy of Bi Sheng and the modern understanding of the earliest movable type has been handed down to later generations. Following an old tradition in China, Shen created a 
raised-relief map while inspecting borderlands. His description of an ancient crossbow mechanism which he himself unearthed proved to be a 




Jacob's staff



, a 
surveying tool which wasn't known in Europe until described by 
Levi ben Gerson in 1321.


Shen Kuo wrote several other books besides the Dream Pool Essays, yet much of the writing in his other books has not survived. Some of Shen's poetry was preserved in posthumous written works. Although much of his focus was on technical and scientific issues, he had an interest in 
divination and the supernatural, the latter including his vivid description of 
unidentified flying objects from eyewitness testimony. He also wrote commentary on ancient 
Daoist and 

Confucian
 texts.



Life



Birth and youth


Shen Kuo was born in Qiantang (modern-day 

Hangzhou
) in the year 1031. His father Shen Zhou (  ; 978 1052) was a somewhat lower-class 
gentry figure serving in official posts on the provincial level; his mother was from a family of equal status in 


Suzhou

, with her maiden name being 
Xu ( ).9 Shen Kuo received his initial childhood education from his mother, which was a common practice in China during this period.9
a[ ] She was very educated herself, teaching Kuo and his brother Pi ( ) the military doctrines of her own elder brother Xu Tang (  ; 975 1016).9 Since Shen was unable to boast of a prominent familial clan history like many of his elite peers born in the north, he was forced to rely on his wit and stern determination to achieve in his studies to enter the challenging and sophisticated life of an 
exam-drafted state bureaucrat.9   





The Bencao on 
traditional Chinese medicine; 
printed with woodblock in 1249; Shen grew ill often as a child, and so developed an interest in medicinal cures.



From about 1040, Shen's family moved around 

Sichuan
 province and finally to the international 
seaport at 

Xiamen
, where Shen's father accepted minor provincial posts in each new location.10 Shen Zhou also served several years in the prestigious capital 
judiciary, the equivalent of a federal supreme court.9 Shen Kuo took notice of the various towns and rural features of China as his family traveled, while he became interested during his youth in the diverse 
topography of the land.10 He also observed the intriguing aspects of his father's engagement in administrative governance and the managerial problems involved; these experiences had a deep impact on him as he later became a government official.10 Since he often became ill as a child, Shen Kuo also developed a natural curiosity about medicine and pharmaceutics.10   


Shen Zhou died in the late winter of 1051 (or early 1052), when his son Shen Kuo was 21 years old. Shen Kuo grieved for his father, and following 

Confucian
 ethics, remained inactive in a state of mourning for three years until 1054 (or early 1055).11 As of 1054, Shen began serving in minor local governmental posts. However, his natural abilities to plan, organize, and design were proven early in life; one example is his design and supervision of the hydraulic drainage of an 
embankment system, 
which converted some one hundred thousand 
acres (400 km ) of 
swampland into prime 
farmland.11 Shen Kuo noted that the success of the 
silt 
fertilization method relied upon the effective operation of 
sluice gates of irrigation 
canals.12




Official career

In 1063 Shen Kuo successfully passed the 
Imperial examinations, the difficult national-level standard test that every high official was required to pass in order to enter the governmental system.11 He not only passed the exam, however, but placed into the higher category of the best and brightest students.11 While serving at 










Yangzhou









, Shen's brilliance and dutiful character caught the attention of Zhang Chu (  ; 1015 1080), the Fiscal Intendant of the region. Shen made a lasting impression upon Zhang, who recommended Shen for a court appointment in the financial administration of the central court.11 Shen would also eventually marry Zhang's daughter, who became his second wife.


In his career as a 
scholar-official for the central government, Shen Kuo was also an ambassador to the 

Western Xia
 Dynasty and 

Liao Dynasty
,13 a military commander, a director of hydraulic works, and the leading chancellor of the 
Hanlin Academy.14 By 1072, Shen was appointed as the head official of the Bureau of Astronomy.11 With his leadership position in the bureau, Shen was responsible for projects in improving calendrical science,15 and proposed many reforms to the 
Chinese calendar alongside the work of his colleague 








Wei Pu







.16 With his impressive skills and aptitude for matters of economy and finance, Shen was appointed as the Finance Commissioner at the central court. 


As written by Li Zhiyi, a man married to Hu Wenrou (granddaughter of Hu Su, a famous minister of the Song Dynasty), Shen Kuo was Li's mentor while Shen served as an official.17 According to Li's epitaph for his wife, Shen would sometimes relay questions via Li to Hu when he needed clarification for his mathematical work, as Hu Wenrou was esteemed by Shen as a remarkable female mathematician.17 Shen lamented:  if only she were a man, Wenrou would be my friend. 17 


While employed by the central government, Shen Kuo was also sent out with others to inspect the granary system of the empire, investigating problems of illegal collections, negligence, ineffective disaster relief, and inadequate water-conservancy projects.18 While Shen was appointed as the regional inspector of Zhejiang in 1073, the Emperor requested that Shen pay a visit to the famous poet 





Su Shi




 (1037 1101), then an administrator in Hangzhou.19 Shen took advantage of this meeting to copy some of Su's poetry, which he presented to the Emperor indicating that it expressed  abusive and hateful  speech against the Song court; these poems were later politicized by Li Ding and Shu Dan in order to level a court case against Su.19 With his demonstrations of loyalty and ability, Shen Kuo was awarded the honorary title of a State Foundation 
Viscount by 










Emperor Shenzong of Song









 (r. 1067 1085), who placed a great amount of trust in Shen Kuo. He was even made 'companion to the heir apparent' (    ; 'Taizi zhongyun').1

At court Shen was a political favorite of the Chancellor 










Wang Anshi









 (1021 1086), who was the leader of the political faction of Reformers, also known as the New Policies Group (  , Xin Fa).20
b[ ] Shen Kuo had a previous history with Wang Anshi, since it was Wang who had composed the funerary 
epitaph for Shen's father, Zhou. Shen Kuo soon impressed Wang Anshi with his skills and abilities as an administrator and government agent. In 1072, Shen was sent to supervise Wang's program of surveying the building of silt deposits in the 
Bian Canal outside the capital city. Using an original technique, Shen successfully dredged the canal and demonstrated the formidable value of the silt gathered as a 
fertilizer. He gained further reputation at court once he was dispatched as an envoy to the 
Khitan Liao Dynasty in the summer of 1075. The Khitans had made several aggressive negotiations of pushing their borders south, while manipulating several incompetent Chinese ambassadors who conceded to the Liao Kingdom's demands. In a brilliant display of diplomacy, Shen Kuo came to the camp of the Khitan monarch at Mt. Yongan (near modern 








Pingquan







, 

Hebei
), armed with copies of previously archived diplomatic negotiations between the Song and Liao dynasties. Shen Kuo refuted 










Emperor Daozong's









 bluffs point for point, while the Song reestablished their rightful border line. In regards to the 
Ly Dynasty of 
  i Vi t (in modern northern 

Vietnam
), Shen demonstrated in his Dream Pool Essays that he was familiar with the key players (on the Vietnamese side) in the prelude to the 
Sino-Vietnamese War of 1075 1077.21 With his reputable achievements, Shen became a trusted member of Wang Anshi's elite circle of eighteen unofficial core political loyalists to the New Policies Group.   





Boundaries of the 
Northern Song Dynasty, the 

Liao Dynasty
, and the 

Western Xia
.


     
Although much of Wang Anshi's reforms outlined in the New Policies centered around state finance, land tax reform, and the Imperial examinations, there were also military concerns. This included policies of raising 
militias to lessen the expense of upholding a million soldiers,22 putting government monopolies on 
saltpetre and 
sulphur production and distribution in 1076 (to ensure that 
gunpowder solutions would not fall into the hands of enemies),2324 and aggressive military policy towards China's northern rivals of the Western Xia and Liao dynasties.25 A few years after Song Dynasty military forces had made victorious territorial gains against the 
Tanguts of the Western Xia, in 1080 Shen Kuo was entrusted as a military officer in defense of Yanzhou (modern-day 

Yan'an
, 

Shaanxi
 province).26 During the autumn months of 1081, Shen was successful in defending Song Dynasty territory while capturing several fortified towns of the Western Xia.27 The Emperor Shenzong of Song rewarded Shen with numerous titles for his merit in these battles, and in the sixteen months of Shen's military campaign, he received 273 letters from the Emperor.27 However, Emperor Shenzong trusted an arrogant military officer who disobeyed the emperor and Shen's proposal for strategic fortifications, instead fortifying what Shen considered useless strategic locations. Furthermore, this officer expelled Shen from his commanding post at the main 
citadel, so as to deny him any glory in chance of victory.27 The result of this was nearly catastrophic, as the forces of the arrogant officer were decimated;27 Xinzhong Yao states that the death toll was 60,000.1 Nonetheless, Shen was successful in defending his fortifications and the only possible Tangut invasion-route to Yanzhou.27




Impeachment and later life


The new Chancellor Cai Que (  ; 1036 1093) held Shen responsible for the disaster and loss of life.27 Along with abandoning the territory which Shen Kuo had fought for, Cai ousted Shen from his seat of office.27 Shen's life was now forever changed, as he lost his once reputable career in state governance and the military.27 Shen was then put under 
probation in a fixed residence for the next six years. However, as he was isolated from governance, he decided to pick up the 
quill and dedicate himself to intensive scholarly studies. After completing two 
geographical 
atlases for a state-sponsored program, Shen was rewarded by having his sentence of probation lifted, allowing him to live in a place of his choice.27 Shen was also pardoned by the court for any previous faults or crimes that were claimed against him.27   





Painting of a Buddhist 
luohan, by Liu Songnian, late 12th early 13th century; Shen Kuo not only listed literati painting as one of his cherished pastimes, but also 
Buddhist meditation.


 
In his more idle years removed from court affairs, Shen Kuo enjoyed pastimes of 
the Chinese gentry and literati that would indicate his intellectual level and cultural taste to others.28 As described in his Dream Pool Essays, Shen Kuo enjoyed the company of the  nine guests  (jiuke), a figure of speech for the 











Chinese zither










, 





Chinese chess




, 
Zen 
Buddhist meditation, ink (
calligraphy and 



painting


), 
tea drinking, 
alchemy, 
chanting poetry, conversation, and 














drinking wine













.29 These nine activities were an extension to the older so-called 





Four Arts of the Chinese Scholar




.


According to 





Zhu Yu




's book Pingzhou Table Talks (    ; Pingzhou Ketan) of 1119, Shen Kuo had two marriages; the second wife was the daughter of Zhang Chu (  ), who came from 








Huainan







. Lady Zhang was said to be overbearing and fierce, often abusive to Shen Kuo, even attempting at one time to pull off his beard. Shen Kuo's children were often upset over this, and prostrated themselves to Lady Zhang to quit this behavior. Despite this, Lady Zhang went as far as to drive out Shen Kuo's son from his first marriage, expelling him from the household. However, after Lady Zhang died, Shen Kuo fell into a deep depression and even attempted to jump into the 

Yangtze River
 to drown himself. Although this suicide attempt failed, he would die a year later.30   


In the 1070s, Shen had purchased a lavish garden estate on the outskirts of modern-day 








Zhenjiang







, 

Jiangsu
 province, a place of great beauty which he named  Dream Brook  ( Mengxi ) after he visited it for the first time in 1086.27 Shen Kuo permanently moved to the Dream Brook Estate in 1088, and in that same year he completed his life's written work of the 








Dream Pool Essays







, naming the book after his garden-estate property. This book was Shen's ultimate attempt to comprehend and describe a multitude of various aspects of nature, science, and reality, and all the practical and profound curiosities found in the world. The literal translation of Mengxi Bitan is  Dream Brook Brush Talks. For this, Shen Kuo is quoted as saying:  Because I had only my writing brush and ink slab to converse with, I call it Brush Talks. 
c[ ] It was there at his peaceful garden estate that Shen Kuo spent the last several years of his life in leisure, isolation, and illness, until his death in 1095.27





Scholarly achievements





The 
shoulder-striped Wainscot (Leucania comma), which is similar to Leucania separata, the 
Noctuidae family pest described by Shen Kuo.



Shen Kuo wrote extensively on a wide range of different subjects. His written work included two geographical 
atlases, a treatise on 
music with mathematical 
harmonics, governmental administration, mathematical astronomy, astronomical instruments, martial 
defensive tactics and 
fortifications, 
painting, 
tea, 
medicine, and much 
poetry.31 While visiting the iron producing district at Cizhou in 1075, Shen described the  partial decarborization  method of reforging cast iron under a cold blast, which Hartwell, Needham, and Wertime state is the predecessor of the 

Bessemer process
.32 Shen believed that 
trees were becoming scarce due to the needs of the 
iron industry and ink makers using pine soot in the production process, so he suggested for the latter an alternative of 
petroleum, which he believed was  produced inexhaustibly within the earth .33
g[ ] Shen used the soot from the smoke of burned petroleum fuel (shi you or  rock oil  as Shen called it) to invent a new, more durable type of writing ink; the 

Ming Dynasty
 pharmacologist 
Li Shizhen (1518 1593) wrote that Shen's ink was  lustrous like 
lacquer, and superior to that made from pinewood lamp-black,  or the soot from pinewood.3435 Shen Kuo described the phenomena of natural 
predator 
insects controlling the population of pests, the latter of which had the potential to wreak havoc upon the agricultural base of China.36 Shen Kuo's scientific writings have received worldwide acclaim by many 
sinologists such as 














Joseph Needham













 and 















Nathan Sivin














. His work has often been compared to that of his equally brilliant Chinese contemporary 




























Su Song



























 (1020 1101), the mechanical genius whose 
astronomical 
clock tower incorporated a 
waterwheel, 
clepsydra, 
escapement mechanism, and 
chain drive to operate the

If the account of 

Sima Qian
 (c. 145 86 BC) in his 

Records of the Grand Historian
 is proven correct upon the unearthing of 


Qin Shi Huang

's (r. 221 210 BC) tomb, the 
raised-relief map has existed since the 

Qin Dynasty
 (221 206 BC).39 Robert Temple and Joseph Needham suggest that certain pottery vessels of the 

Han Dynasty
 (202 BC   220 AD) showing artificial mountains as lid decorations may have influenced the raised-relief map.40 The Han Dynasty general 











Ma Yuan










 (14 BC   49 AD) made a raised-relief map of valleys and mountains in a rice-constructed model of 32 AD.39 Such rice models were expounded on by the 

Tang Dynasty
 (618 907) author Jiang Fang in his Essay on the Art of Constructing Mountains with Rice (c. 845 AD).39 A raised-relief map made of wood representing all the provinces of the empire and put together like a giant 0.93 m2 (10 ft2) 
jigsaw puzzle was invented by Xie Zhuang (421 466 AD) during the 










Liu Song Dynasty









 (420 479).39 


Shen's largest atlas included twenty three maps of China and foreign regions that were drawn at a uniform scale of 1:900,000.5 Shen also created a 
three dimensional raised-relief map using sawdust, wood, beeswax, and wheat paste.54142 

Zhu Xi
 (1130 1200) was inspired by the raised-relief map of Huang Shang and so made his own portable map made of wood and clay which could be folded up from eight hinged pieces.4342 Later, 

Ibn Battuta
 (1304 1377) described a raised-relief map while visiting 

Gibraltar
, while European raised-relief maps started with a Paul Dox who made one to represent 

Kufstein
, 

Austria
, in 1510.4445 The Englishman 










John Evelyn









 (1620 1706), in his 1665 paper featured in the 






Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society





, wrote that the raised-relief map was something new from 

France
.44




Pharmacology





Further information: 



Traditional Chinese medicine




For 
pharmacology, Shen wrote of the difficulties of adequate 
diagnosis and 
therapy, as well as the proper selection, preparation, and administration of drugs.46 He held great concern for detail and 
philological accuracy in identification, use and cultivation of different types of medicinal herbs, such as in which months medicinal plants should be gathered, their exact ripening times, which parts should be used for therapy; for domesticated herbs he wrote about planting times, fertilization, and other matters of 
horticulture. In the realms of 
botany, 
zoology, and 
mineralogy, Shen Kuo documented and systematically described hundreds of different plants, agricultural crops, rare vegetation, animals, and 
minerals found in China.474849 For example, Shen noted that the mineral 
orpiment was used to quickly erase writing errors on paper.50




Engineering

The writing of Shen Kuo is the only source for the date when the 
drydock was first used in China. Shen Kuo wrote that during the Xi-Ning reign (1068 1077), the court official Huang Huaixin devised a plan for repairing 60 m (200 ft) long 
palatial boats that were a century old; essentially, Huang Huaixin devised the first Chinese drydock for suspending boats out of water. These boats were then placed in a roof-covered dock warehouse to protect them from weathering.51 Shen  also wrote about the effectiveness of the new invention (i.e. by the 10th century engineer 
Qiao Weiyo) of the 
pound lock to replace the old 
flash lock design used in canals. He wrote that it saved the work of five hundred annual labors, annual costs of up to 1,250,000 strings of cash, and increased the size limit of boats accommodated from  21 
tons/21000 
kg to 113 
tons/115000 
kg.52 


If it were not for Shen Kuo's analysis and quoting in his 








Dream Pool Essays







 of the writings of the 
architect 










Yu Hao









 (fl. 970), the latter's work would have been lost to history.53
d[ ] Yu designed a famous wooden 
pagoda that burned down in 1044 and was replaced in 1049 by a brick pagoda (the '






Iron Pagoda





') of similar height, but not of his design. From Shen's quotation or perhaps Shen's own paraphrasing of Yu Hao's Timberwork Manual (  ; Mujing) shows that already in the 10th century there was a graded system of building unit proportions, a system which Shen states had become more precise in his time but stating no one could possibly reproduce such a sound work.54 However, he did not anticipate the more complex and matured system of unit proportions embodied in the extensive written work by scholar-official Li Jie (1065 1110), the 







Treatise on Architectural Methods






 (    ; Yingzao Fashi) of 1103.5554 Klaas Ruitenbeek states that the version of the Timberwork Manual quoted by Shen is most likely Shen's summarization of Yu's work or a corrupted passage of the original by Yu Hao, as Shen writes:  According to some, the work was written by Yu Hao. 56




Anatomy


The Chinese had long taken an interest in examining the human body. For example, in 16 AD the 







Xin Dynasty






 usurper 

Wang Mang
 called for the dissection of an executed man, to examine his arteries and viscera in order to discover cures for illnesses.57 Shen also took interest in human 
anatomy, dispelling the long-held Chinese theory that the throat contained three valves, writing,  When liquid and solid are imbibed together, how can it be that in one's mouth they sort themselves into two throat channels? 58 Shen maintained that the 
larynx was the beginning of a system that distributed vital 
qi from the air throughout the body, and that the 
esophagus was a simple tube that dropped food into the stomach.59 Following Shen's reasoning and correcting the findings of the 
dissection of executed bandits in 1045, an early 12th century Chinese account of a bodily dissection finally supported Shen's belief in two throat valves, not three.60  Also, the later Song Dynasty judge and early 
forensic expert 















Song Ci














 (1186 1249) would promote the use of 
autopsy in order to solve 
homicide cases, as written in his 






Collected Cases of Injustice Rectified





.61

An 18th century diagram of 
camera obscura



In the broad field of 
mathematics, Shen Kuo mastered many practical mathematical problems, including many complex formulas for 
geometry,62 'packing' equations for 
calculus,63 and chords and arcs problems employing 
trigonometry.64 Shen addressed problems of writing out very large numbers, as large as 1043. Shen's  technique of small increments  laid the foundation in Chinese mathematics for packing problems involving equal difference series.65 Sal Restivo writes that Shen used summation of higher series to ascertain the number of kegs which could be piled in layers in a space shaped like the 
frustum of a rectangular pyramid.66 In his formula  technique of intersecting circles , he created an approximation of the arc of a circle s given the diameter d, sagita v, and length of the chord c subtending the arc, the length of which he approximated as s = c + 2v2/d.65 Restivo writes that Shen's work in the lengths of arcs of circles provided the basis for 
spherical trigonometry developed in the 13th century by 







Guo Shoujing






 (1231 1316).66 He also simplified the 
counting rods technique by outlining short cuts in algorithm procedures used on the counting board, an idea expanded on by the mathematician 





Yang Hui




 (1238 1298).67 Victor J. Katz asserts that Shen's method of  dividing by 9, increase by 1; dividing by 8, increase by 2,  was a direct forerunner to the rhyme scheme method of repeated addition  9, 1, bottom add 1; 9, 2, bottom add 2 .68


Shen wrote extensively about what he had learned while working for the state treasury, including mathematical problems posed by computing 
land tax, estimating requirements, 
currency issues, 
metrology, and so forth.69 Shen once computed the amount of 
terrain space required for battle formations in 
military strategy,70 and also computed the longest possible military campaign given the limits of human carriers who would bring their own food and food for other soldiers.71  Shen wrote about the earlier 













Yi Xing












 (672 717), a Buddhist monk who applied an early 
escapement mechanism to a water-powered 
celestial globe.72 By using mathematical 
permutations, Shen described Yi Xing's calculation of possible positions on a 
go board game. Shen calculated the total number for this using up to five rows and twenty five game pieces, which yielded the number 847,288,609,443.7374


Shen Kuo experimented with the 
pinhole camera and burning mirror as the ancient Chinese 
Mohists had done in the 4th century BC. Although the 
Iraqi 
Muslim scientist 

Ibn al-Haytham
 (965 1039) was the first to experiment with 
camera obscura, Shen Kuo was the first to apply 
geometrical and 
quantitative attributes to the camera obscura, just several decades after Ibn al-Haytham's death.75  Using a fitting metaphor, Shen compared optical image inversion to an 
oarlock and waisted drum. He also discussed 
focal points and noted that the image in a 
concave mirror is inverted. Shen, who never asserted that he was the first to experiment with camera obscura, hints in his writing that camera obscura was dealt with in the 

Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang

 (d. 863) during the 

Tang Dynasty
 (618 907), in regards to the inverted image of a 
Chinese pagoda by a seashore.75




Magnetic needle compass

List of Chinese inventions

Since the time of the engineer and inventor 









Ma Jun








 (c. 200 265), the Chinese had used a mechanical device known as the 
South Pointing Chariot in order to navigate on land (and possibly at sea, as the Song Shu text of c. 500 alludes). This device was especially impressive, since it featured the use of a 
differential gear, an essential component used in the correct steering and application of equal amount of 
torque for the wheels of all modern 
automobiles. In 1044 the 






Collection of the Most Important Military Techniques





 (    ; Wujing Zongyao) recorded that fish-shaped objects cut from sheet iron, magnetized by  (essentially, heating that produced weak magnetic force), and placed in a water-filled bowl enclosed by a box were used for directional pathfinding alongside the South Pointing Chariot.76 





A 

Han Dynasty
 (202 BC 220 AD) ladle-and-basin 
lodestone south-pointing 
compass, used by ancient Chinese 
geomancers, but not for navigation.



However, it was not until the time of Shen Kuo that the earliest 
magnetic 
compasses would be used for 
navigation. In his written work, Shen Kuo made one of the first references in human history to the magnetic compass-needle, the concept of 
true north, and its use for navigation at sea.1477 He wrote that steel needles were magnetized once they were rubbed with 
lodestone, and that they were put in floating position or in mountings; he described the suspended compass as the best form to be used, and noted that the magnetic needle of compasses pointed either south or north.7879 Shen Kuo asserted that the needle will point south but with a deviation,79 stating  [the magnetic needles] are always displaced slightly east rather than pointing due south. 78


Shen Kuo wrote that it was preferable to use the twenty-four-point rose instead of the old eight compass cardinal points   and the former was recorded in use for navigation shortly after Shen's death.5 The preference of use for the twenty-four-point-rose compass may have arisen from Shen's finding of a more accurate 
astronomical meridian, determined by his measurement between the polestar and true north;5 however, it could also have been inspired by 
geomantic beliefs and practices.5 The book of the author 





Zhu Yu




, the Pingzhou Table Talks published in 1119 (written from 1111 to 1117), was the first record of use of a compass for seafaring navigation.77 However, Zhu Yu's book recounts events back to 1086, when Shen Kuo was writing the Dream Pool Essays; this meant that in Shen's time the compass might have already been in navigational use.80 In any case, Shen Kuo's writing on magnetic compasses has proved invaluable for understanding China's earliest use of the compass for seafaring navigation.




Archaeology





Further information: 

Song Dynasty#Archaeology





Many of Shen Kuo's contemporaries were interested in 
antiquarian pursuits of collecting old artworks.82 They were also interested in 
archaeological pursuits, although for rather different reasons than why Shen Kuo held an interest in archaeology. While Shen's educated Confucian contemporaries were interested in obtaining ancient relics and antiques in order to revive their use in rituals, Shen was more concerned with how items from archeological finds were originally manufactured and what their functionality would have been, based on empirical evidence.83 Shen Kuo criticized those in his day who reconstructed ancient ritual objects using only their imagination and not the tangible evidence from archeological digs or finds.83 Shen also disdained the notion of others that these objects were products of the  sages  or the 
aristocratic class of antiquity, rightfully crediting the items' manufacture and production to the common working people and artisans of previous eras.83 Fraser and Haber write that Shen Kuo  advocated the use of an 





interdisciplinary




 approach to archaeology and practiced such an approach himself through his work in 
metallurgy, optics, and geometry in the study of ancient measures. 83


While working in the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen Kuo's interest in archaeology and old relics led him to reconstruct an armillary sphere from existing models as well as from ancient texts that could provide additional information.83 Shen used ancient mirrors while conducting his optics experiments.83 He observed ancient weaponry, describing the 




scaled sight devices



 on ancient 
crossbows and the ancients' production of swords with composite blades that had a midrib of 
wrought iron and 
low-carbon 
steel while having two sharp edges of 
high-carbon steel.83 Being a knowledgeable musician, Shen also suggested suspending 




an ancient bell



 by using a hollow handle.83 In his assessment of the carved 
reliefs of the ancient Zhuwei Tomb, Shen stated that the reliefs demonstrate genuine 

Han Dynasty
 (202 BC 220 AD) era clothing.84


After unearthing an ancient crossbow device from a house's garden in Haichow, Jiangsu, Shen discovered that the cross-wire grid sighting device, marked in graduated measurements on the stock, could be used to calculate the height of a distant mountain in the same way that mathematicians could apply right-angle triangles to measure height.85 Needham asserts Shen had discovered the survey device known as 




Jacob's staff



, which was not described elsewhere until the 
Provencal Jewish mathematician 
Levi ben Gerson (1288 1344) wrote of it in 1321.86 Shen wrote that while viewing the whole of a mountain, the distance on the instrument was long, but while viewing a small part of the mountainside the distance was short due to the device's cross piece that had to be pushed further away from the observer's eye, with the graduation starting on the further end.85 He wrote that if one placed an arrow on the device and looked past its end, the degree of the mountain could be measured and thus its height could be calculated.85




Geology





View of the 


Taihang Mountains

, where Shen Kuo had his 
epiphany about 
geomorphology.



The ancient 
Greek 


Aristotle

 (384 BC 322 BC) wrote in his 





Meteorology




 of how the earth had the potential for physical change, including the belief that all rivers and seas at one time did not exist where they were, and were dry. The Greek writer 









Xenophanes








 (570 BC 480 BC) wrote of how inland 
marine 
fossils were evidence that massive periodic 
flooding had wiped out mankind several times in the past, but never wrote of land formation or shifting seashores.87 











Du Yu










 (222 285) a Chinese 
Jin Dynasty officer, believed that the land of hills would eventually be leveled into valleys and valleys would gradually rise to form hills.88 The Daoist alchemist 








Ge Hong







 (284 364) wrote of the legendary immortal 
Ma Gu; in a written dialogue by Ge, Ma Gu described how what was once the Eastern Sea (i.e. 
East China Sea) had transformed into solid land where 
mulberry trees grew, and would one day be filled with mountains and dry, dusty lands.88 The later 

Persian
 
Muslim scholar 
Ab  Rayh n al-B r n  (973 1048) hypothesized that 
India was once covered by the 
Indian Ocean while observing rock formations at the mouths of rivers.89 


It was Shen Kuo who formulated a hypothesis about the process of land formation (
geomorphology) based upon several observations as evidence. This included his observation of 
fossil shells in a 
geological stratum of a mountain hundreds of miles from the ocean. He inferred that the land was reshaped and formed by 
erosion of the mountains, uplift, and the deposition of 
silt, after observing strange natural erosions of the 


Taihang Mountains

 and the Yandang Mountain near 











Wenzhou










.90 He hypothesized that, with the inundation of silt, the land of the continent must have been formed over an enormous span of time. While visiting the Taihang Mountains in 1074, Shen Kuo noticed strata of 
bivalve shells and 
ovoid rocks in a horizontal-running span through a cliff like a large belt.91 Shen proposed that the cliff was once the location of an ancient seashore that by his time had shifted hundreds of miles east.91 Shen wrote that in the Zhiping reign period (1064 1067) a man of Zezhou unearthed an object in his garden that looked like a serpent or dragon, and after examining it, concluded the dead animal had apparently turned to  stone .9293 The magistrate of 








Jincheng







, Zheng Boshun, examined the creature as well, and noted the same scale-like markings that were seen on other marine animals.9293 Shen Kuo likened this to the  stone crabs  found in China.9293





Bamboo and rocks by Li Kan (1244 1320); using evidence of fossilized bamboo within China's dry northwestern climate zone, Shen Kuo hypothesized that 
climates naturally shifted geographically over time.


 
Shen also wrote that since petrified bamboos were found underground in a climatic area where they had never been known to be grown, 
climates naturally shifted geographically over time.9394 Around the year 1080, Shen Kuo noted that a landslide on the bank of a large river near Yanzhou (modern 

Yan'an
) had revealed an open space several dozens of feet under the ground once the bank collapsed.9394 This underground space contained hundreds of petrified bamboos still intact with roots and trunks,  all turned to stone  as Shen Kuo wrote.9394 Shen Kuo noted that bamboos do not grow in Yanzhou, located in northern China, and he was puzzled during which previous dynasty the bamboos could have grown.9394 Considering that damp and gloomy low places provide suitable conditions for the growth of bamboo, Shen deduced that the climate of Yanzhou must have fit that description in very ancient times.9394 Although this would have intrigued many of his readers, the study of 
paleoclimatology in medieval China never developed into an established discipline.


The philosopher 

Zhu Xi
 (1130 1200) wrote of this curious natural phenomenon of fossils as well.  He was known to have read the works of Shen Kuo.93   Shen's description of soil erosion and weathering predated that of 
Georgius Agricola in his book of 1546, De veteribus et novis metallis. Furthermore, Shen's theory of sedimentary deposition predated that of 


James Hutton

, who published his groundbreaking work in 1802 (considered the foundation of modern geology).95  Historian 














Joseph Needham













 likened Shen's account to that of the 


Scottish

 scientist 
Roderick Murchison (1792 1871), who was inspired to become a geologist after observing a providential landslide.




Meteorology





Shen accurately hypothesized that 
rainbows were caused by sunlight onto rain droplets.



Early speculation and hypothesis pertaining to what is now known as 
meteorology had a long tradition in China before Shen Kuo. For example, the philosopher 









Wang Chong








 (27 97 AD) accurately described the process of the 
water cycle.96 Shen wrote vivid descriptions of 
tornadoes the first known description of them in East Asia and gave reasoning (earlier proposed by Sun Sikong, 1015 1076) that 
rainbows were formed by the shadow of the sun in rain, occurring when the sun would shine upon it.979899 Paul Dong writes that Shen's explanation of the rainbow as a phenomenon of 
atmospheric refraction  is basically in accord with modern scientific principles.  Shen hypothesized that rays of sunlight refract before reaching the surface of the earth, hence people on earth observing the sun are not viewing it in its exact position. Shen also hypothesized that the altitude of the apparent sun is higher than the actual altitude of the sun. Dong writes that  at the time, this discovery was remarkably original.  It should be noted that 

Ibn al-Haytham
, in his 






Book of Optics





 (1021), also discussed atmospheric refraction (in regards to 
twilight), while 
















Roger Bacon















 (1214 1294) wrote that the colors of the rainbow were caused by the reflection and refraction of sunlight through rain drops.100




Astronomy and instruments





Further information: 
Chinese astronomy




One of five 
star maps published in 




























Su Song



























's horological and astronomical book of 1092 AD, featuring Shen Kuo's corrected position of the 
pole star.



Being the head official for the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen Kuo was an avid scholar of medieval astronomy, and improved the designs of several astronomical instruments. Shen is credited with making improved designs of the 
gnomon, 
armillary sphere, and 
clepsydra clock.101 For the clepsydra he designed a new overflow-tank type, and argued for a more efficient higher-order 
interpolation instead of linear interpolation in calibrating the measure of time.101 Improving the 5th century model of the astronomical 
sighting tube, Shen Kuo widened its diameter so that the new calibration could observe the 
polestar indefinitely.101 This came about due to the position of the polestar shifting in position since the time of 





Zu Geng




 in the 5th century, hence Shen Kuo diligently observed the course of the polestar for three months, plotting the data of its course and coming to the conclusion that it had shifted slightly over three degrees.101 Apparently this astronomical finding had an impact upon the intellectual community in China at the time. Even Shen's political rival and contemporary astronomer 




























Su Song



























 featured Shen's corrected position of the polestar (halfway between Tian shu, at -350 degrees, and the current 







Polaris






) in the fourth 
star map of his celestial atlas.102  Along with his colleague 








Wei Pu







 in the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen Kuo plotted out exact coordinates of planetary and lunar movements by recording their astronomical observations three times a night for a continuum of five years.16 Although star maps were created then and in previous times, an extensively long and time-consuming method of astronomical observation on the scale of Shen Kuo and Wei Pu's project was not proposed in Europe until the time of the astronomer 

Tycho Brahe
 (1546 1601).16 The Chinese scholar Mei Wending (   ; 1633 1721) even pointed out that Guo Shoujing's regular recording of the planet's positions during the 13th century predated that of Tycho Brahe's work.103

The astronomical phenomena of the 
solar eclipse and 
lunar eclipse had been known in China since at least the time of the astronomers 










Gan De









 (fl. 4th century BC) and 










Shi Shen









 (fl. 4th century BC), since it was Shi Shen who gave instructions on predicting the eclipses based on the relative position of the moon to the sun.104 The philosopher Wang Chong argued against the 'radiating influence' theory of 

Jing Fang
's writing in the 1st century BC and that of the astronomer 

Zhang Heng
 (78 139), the latter two of whom correctly hypothesized that the brightness of the 
moon was merely light reflected from the 
sun.105 Jing Fang had written in the 1st century BC of how it was long accepted in China that the sun and moon were 
spherical in shape ('like a 
crossbow bullet'), not flat.106 Shen Kuo also wrote of solar and lunar eclipses in this manner, yet expanded upon this to explain why the celestial bodies were spherical, going against the '
flat earth' theory for celestial bodies.107 However, there is no evidence to suggest that Shen Kuo supported a round earth theory, which was introduced into Chinese science by 













Matteo Ricci












 and 










Xu Guangqi









 in the 17th century.108 When the Director of the Astronomical 
Observatory asked Shen Kuo if the shapes of the sun and moon were round like balls or flat like fans, Shen Kuo explained that celestial bodies were spherical because of knowledge of waxing and waning of the moon.107 Much like what Zhang Heng had said, Shen Kuo likened the moon to a ball of silver, which does not produce light, but simply reflects light if provided from another source (the sun).107 He explained that when the sun's light is slanting, the moon appears full.107 He then explained if one were to cover any sort of sphere with white powder, and then viewed from the side it would appear to be a crescent, hence he reasoned that celestial bodies were spherical.107109 He also wrote that, although the sun and moon were in conjunction and opposition with each other once a month, this did not mean the sun would be eclipsed every time their paths met, because of the small obliquity of their orbital paths.107110


Shen Kuo is also known for his 
cosmological hypotheses in explaining the variations of 
planetary motions, including 
retrogradation.111 His colleague Wei Pu realized that the old calculation technique for the mean sun was inaccurate compared to the 
apparent sun, since the latter was ahead of it in the accelerated phase of motion, and behind it in the retarded phase.112 Shen's hypotheses were similar to the concept of the 
epicycle in the 
Greco-Roman tradition,111 only Shen compared the side-section of 
orbital paths of planets and variations of planetary speeds to points in the tips of a 
willow leaf.113 In a similar rudimentary physical analogy of celestial motions, as John B. Henderson describes it, Shen likened the relationship of the moon's path to the ecliptic, the path of the sun,  to the figure of a rope coiled about a tree. 114 


The Song Dynasty astronomers of Shen's day still retained the lunar theory and coordinates of the earlier 













Yi Xing












, which after 350 years had devolved into a state of considerable error.16 Shen criticized earlier Chinese astronomers for failing to describe celestial movement in spacial terms, yet he did not attempt to provide any reasoning for the motive power of the planets or other celestial movements.114 Shen and Wei kept astronomical records for the moon similar to those they recorded for the planets, plotting its location three times a night for five successive years.16 The officials and astronomers at court deeply opposed Wei and Shen's work, offended by their insistence that the coordinates of the renowned Yi Xing were inaccurate.115 They also slandered Wei Pu, out of resentment that a commoner had expertise exceeding theirs.116 When Wei and Shen made a public demonstration using the gnomon to prove the doubtful wrong, the other ministers reluctantly agreed to correct the lunar and solar errors.115117 Despite this success, they eventually dismissed Wei and Shen's tables of planetary motions.118 Therefore, only the worst and most obvious planetary errors were corrected, and many inaccuracies remained.116




Movable type printing

History of typography in East Asia




The Chinese 





Diamond Sutra

woodblock printing.



Shen Kuo wrote that during the Qingli reign period (1041 1048), under 










Emperor Renzong of Song









 (1022 1063), an obscure commoner and 
artisan known as 








Bi Sheng







 (990 1051) invented ceramic 
movable type 
printing.119120 Although the use of assembling individual characters to compose a piece of text had its origins in 
antiquity, Bi Sheng's methodical innovation was something completely revolutionary for his time. Shen Kuo noted that the process was tedious if one only wanted to print a few copies of a book, but if one desired to make hundreds or thousands of copies, the process was incredibly fast and efficient.119 Beyond Shen Kuo's writing, however, nothing is known of Bi Sheng's life or the influence of movable type in his lifetime.121 Although the details of Bi Sheng's life were scarcely known, Shen Kuo wrote: 
When Bi Sheng died, his 
fount of type passed into the possession of my followers (i.e. one of Shen's nephews), among whom it has been kept as a precious possession until now.2122

movable type characters arranged primarily by rhyming scheme, from

's book of agriculture published in 1313.



There are a few surviving examples of books printed in the late Song Dynasty using movable type printing.123 This includes Zhou Bida's Notes of The Jade Hall (    ) printed in 1193 using the method of baked-clay movable type characters outlined in the Dream Pool Essays.124 Yao Shu (1201 1278), an advisor to 











Kublai Khan










, once persuaded a disciple Yang Gu to print 
philological 
primers and Neo-Confucian texts by using what he termed the  movable type of Shen Kuo .125 










Wang Zhen









 (fl. 1290 1333), who wrote the valuable agricultural, scientific, and technological treatise of the Nong Shu, mentioned an alternative method of baking 
earthenware type with earthenware frames in order to make whole blocks.125 Wang Zhen also improved its use by inventing wooden movable type in the years 1297 or 1298, while he was a magistrate of 
Jingde, 

Anhui
 province.126 The earlier Bi Sheng had experimented with wooden movable type,127 but Wang's main contribution was improving the speed of typesetting with simple mechanical devices, along with the complex, systematic arrangement of wooden movable type involving the use of revolving tables.128 Although later metal movable type would be used in China, Wang Zhen experimented with 
tin metal movable type, but found its use to be inefficient.129


By the 15th century, metal movable type printing was developed in 

Ming Dynasty
 China (and earlier in 
Joseon 

Korea
, by the mid 13th century), and was widely applied in China by at least the 16th century.130 In 

Jiangsu
 and 

Fujian
, wealthy Ming era families sponsored the use of metal type printing (mostly using 
bronze). This included the printing works of 










Hua Sui









 (1439 1513), who pioneered the first Chinese bronze-type movable printing in the year 1490.131 In 1718, during the mid 

Qing Dynasty
 (1644 1912), the scholar of 








Tai'an







 known as Xu Zhiding developed movable type with 


















enamel

















ware instead of earthenware.125 There was also Zhai Jinsheng (b. 1784), a teacher of 
Jingxian, 

Anhui
, who spent thirty years making a font of earthenware movable type, and by 1844 he had over 100,000 Chinese writing characters in five sizes.125 


Despite these advances, movable type printing never gained the amount of widespread use in East Asia that 
woodblock printing had achieved since the Chinese 

Tang Dynasty
 in the 9th century. With 
written Chinese, the vast amount of written 
morpheme characters impeded movable type's acceptance and practical use, and was therefore seen as largely unsatisfactory.119 Furthermore, the European 
printing press, first invented by 


Johannes Gutenberg

 (1398 1468), was eventually wholly adopted as the standard in China, yet the tradition of woodblock printing remains popular in East Asian countries still.




Beliefs, philosophy, and phenomenon

Chinese philosophy




A painting by 






Dong Yuan





, who Shen praised for his ability to portray landscapes and natural scenery in a grand but realistic style.






Ideas of the philosopher 

Mencius
 deeply influenced Shen.






On 
April 14, 1561 the skies over 

Nuremberg
, 

Germany
 were reportedly filled with a multitude of objects, as portrayed in this woodcut; Shen Kuo described an account of a floating  pearl  with doors as large as a bed that opened and produced blinding light from its interior before taking off at tremendous speeds.



Shen Kuo's writings were not all about scientific or practical subjects. Besides his writing on Chinese 
divination, 
magic, and 
folklore, Shen Kuo was also an 
art critic. Shen criticized the artwork of the painter 






Li Cheng





 (919 967) for failing to observe the principle of  seeing the small from the viewpoint of the large  in portraying buildings and the like.132 He praised the works of 






Dong Yuan





 (c. 934 c. 962); he noted that although a close-up view of Dong's work would create the impression that his brush techniques were cursory, seen from afar his landscape paintings would give the impression of grand, resplendent, and realistic scenery.133134135 In addition, Shen's writing on Dong's artworks represents the earliest known reference to the 


Jiangnan

 style of painting.136 In his  Song on Painting  and in his Dream Pool Essays, Shen praised the creative artworks of the Tang painter 




Wang Wei



 (701 761); Shen noted that Wang was unique in that he  penetrated into the mysterious reason and depth of creative activity,  but was criticized by others for not conforming his paintings to reality, such as his painting with a banana tree growing in a snowy, wintry landscape.137138139


Shen Kuo was much in favor of philosophical 
Daoist notions which challenged the authority of empirical science in his day. Although much could be discerned through empirical observation and recorded study, Daoism asserted that the secrets of the universe were boundless, something that scientific investigation could merely express in fragments and partial understandings.140 Shen Kuo referred to the ancient Daoist 
Book of Changes in explaining the spiritual processes and attainment of foreknowledge that cannot be attained through  crude traces , which he likens to mathematical astronomy.140 Nathan Sivin proposes that Shen was the first in history to  make a clear distinction between our unconnected experiences and the unitary causal world we postulate to explain them,  which Biderman and Scharfstein state is arguably inherent in the works of 


Heraclitus

, 


Plato

, and 


Democritus

 as well.141 Shen was a firm believer in destiny and prognostication, and made rational explanations for the relations between them.142 Shen held a special interest in fate, mystical divination, bizarre phenomena, yet warned against the tendency to believe that all matters in life were preordained.143 When describing an event where 
lightning had struck a house and all the wooden walls did not burn (but simply turned black) and 
lacquerwares inside were fine, yet metal objects had melted into liquid, Shen Kuo wrote: 


Most people can only judge of things by the experiences of ordinary life, but phenomena outside the scope of this are really quite numerous. How insecure it is to investigate natural principles using only the light of common knowledge, and subjective ideas.144


In his commentary on the ancient Confucian philosopher 

Mencius
 (372 289 BC), Shen wrote of the importance of choosing to follow what one knew to be a true path, yet the heart and mind could not attain full knowledge of truth through mere sensory experience.145 In his own unique way but using terms influenced by the ideas of Mencius, Shen wrote of an autonomous inner authority that formed the basis for one's inclination towards moral choices, a concept linked to Shen's life experiences of surviving and obtaining success through self-reliance.145 Along with his commentary on the 

Chinese classic texts
, Shen Kuo also wrote extensively on the topics of supernatural 
divination and 
Buddhist 
meditation.146


In a passage of the Dream Pool Essays called  Strange Happenings , Shen provided a peculiar account of an 
unidentified flying object that Professor Zhang Longqiao of the Chinese Department of Peking Teachers College states is  a clue that a flying craft from some other planet once landed somewhere near 










Yangzhou









 in China. 147 Zhang popularized this account in Beijing's Guang Ming Daily on 
February 18, 
1979, in an article called  Could It Be That A Visitor From Outer Space Visited China Long Ago? 147 Shen wrote that, during the reign of Emperor Renzong (1022 1063), an object as bright as a pearl occasionally hovered over the city of 










Yangzhou









 at night, but described first by local inhabitants of eastern 

Anhui
 and then in 

Jiangsu
.147 Shen wrote that a man near 

Xingkai Lake
 observed this curious object; allegedly it: 



...opened its door and a flood of intense light like sunbeams darted out of it, then the outer shell opened up, appearing as large as a bed with a big pearl the size of a fist illuminating the interior in silvery white. The intense silver-white light, shot from the interior, was too strong for human eyes to behold; it cast shadows of every tree within a radius of ten miles. The spectacle was like the rising sun, lighting up the distant sky and woods in red. Then all of a sudden, the object took off at a tremendous speed and descended upon the lake like the sun setting.148



Shen went on to say that Yibo, a poet of 








Gaoyou







, wrote a poem about this  pearl  after witnessing it. Shen wrote that since the  pearl  often made an appearance around Fanliang in Yangzhou, the people there erected a  Pearl Pavilion  on a wayside, where people came by boat in hopes to see the mysterious flying object.149





Dream Pool Essays''





Main article: 








Dream Pool Essays









As the historian Chen Dengyuan points out, much of Shen Kuo's written work was probably purged under the leadership of minister 








Cai Jing







 (1046 1126), who revived the New Policies of Wang Anshi, although he set out on a campaign of attrition to destroy or radically alter the written work of his predecessors and especially Conservative enemies.150 For example, only six of Shen's books remain, and four of these have been significantly altered since the time they were penned by the author.151 The Dream Pool Essays was first quoted in a Chinese written work of 1095, showing that even towards the end of Shen's life his final book was becoming widely printed. Shen Kuo's Dream Pool Essays consists of some 507 separate essays exploring a wide range of subjects.152 The book was originally 30 chapters long, yet an unknown Chinese author's edition of 1166 edited and reorganized the work into 26 chapters.153 There is one surviving copy of this 1166 edition housed now in 
Japan, while a Chinese reprint was produced in 1305 as well.153 In 1631 another edition was printed, but it was heavily reorganized into three broad chapters.153 In the Chiwuming Shitukao (Illustrated Investigations of the Names and Natures of Plants) book of 1848, written material of Shen's Mengxi Bitan is mentioned often, such as classifications of plant species.154


In modern times, the best attempt at a complete list and summary of Shen's writing was an appendix written by Hu Daojing in his standard edition of Brush Talks, written in 1956.150 Of the 1166 Chinese edition, it was accurately translated into 

Japanese
 by the History of Science Seminar, Institute for Research in Humanities (Jimbun Kagaku Kenkyusho) for 

Kyoto University
, printed by the author Umehara Kaoru in his 3 volume edition of Bokei hitsudan (1978 1981).155 Selected translations of the Dream Pool Essays from 
Middle Chinese into modern 
Vernacular Chinese was made by Zhang Jia Ju's biographical work Shen Kuo (1962). Zhang's biography on Shen is of great importance as it contains according to the historian 















Nathan Sivin














 (b. 1931) the fullest and most accurate account of Shen Kuo's life.155 The largest amount of selected translations in 

English
 for the Dream Pool Essays are found in various volumes of 














Joseph Needham













's Science and Civilization in China series, from 1954 onwards.155 In 

French
, quoted excerpts from the Dream Pool Essays were printed in the written work of J. Brenier in 1989 
e[ ] as well as J. F. Billeter in 1993.
f[ ]




Other written works





A Song era portrait of the poet and statesman 





Su Shi




, whose pharmaceutical work was combined with Shen Kuo's in 1126.



Although the Dream Pool Essays is certainly his most extensive and important work, Shen Kuo wrote other books as well.  In 1075, Shen Kuo wrote the Xining Fengyuan Li (     ; The Oblatory Epoch astronomical system of the Splendid Peace reign period), which was lost, but listed in a 7th chapter of a Song Dynasty bibliography.156  This was the official report of Shen Kuo on his reforms of the Chinese calendar, which were only partially adopted by the Song court's official calendar system.156  Shen Kuo wrote a 
pharmaceutical treatise known as the Liang Fang (  ; Good medicinal formulas), compiled sometime during his years of retirement from governmental service. Around the year 1126 it was combined into a written work of the famous 





Su Shi




 (1037 1101), who was ironically a political opponent to Shen Kuo's faction of Reformers and New Policies supporters at court,157 yet it was known that Shen Kuo and Su Shi were nonetheless friends and associates.158 Shen wrote the Mengqi Wanghuai Lu (     ; Record of longings forgotten at Dream Brook), which was also compiled during Shen's retirement.  This book was a treatise in the working since his youth on rural life and ethnographic accounts of living conditions in the isolated mountain regions of China.159  Only quotations of it survive in the Shuo Fu (  ) collection, which mostly describe the agricultural implements and tools used by rural people in high mountain regions.  Shen Kuo also wrote the Changxing Ji (   ; Collected Literary Works of [the Viscount of] Changxing).  However, this book was without much doubt a posthumous collection, including various poems, prose, and administrative documents written by Shen.159 By the 15th century (during the 

Ming Dynasty
), this book was reprinted, yet only the 19th chapter remained.159  This chapter was reprinted in 1718, yet poorly edited.159  Finally, in the 1950s the author Hu Daojing supplemented this small yet valuable work with additions of other scattered poems written by Shen, in the former's Collection of Shen Kua's Extant Poetry (Shanghai: Shang-hai Shu-tian, 1958).159 In the tradition of the popular Song era literary category of 'travel record literature' ('youji wenxue'),160 Shen Kuo also wrote the Register of What Not to Forget, a 
traveler's guide to what type of 
carriage is suitable for a journey, the proper foods one should bring, the special clothing one should bring, and many other items.161


In his Sequel to Numerous Things Revealed, the Song author Cheng Dachang (1123 1195) noted that stanzas prepared by Shen Kuo for military victory celebrations were later written down and published by Shen.162 This includes a short poem  Song of Triumph  by Shen Kuo, who uses the musical instrument 
mawei huqin ('horse-tail barbarian stringed instrument' or 'horse-tail fiddle'163) of the northwestern 
Inner Asian nomads as a metaphor for prisoners-of-war led by Song troops:





 


Cquote1.png






The mawei huqin followed the Han chariot,

:Its music sounding of complaint to the Khan.


Do not bend the bow to shoot the goose within the clouds,

:The returning goose bears no letter.

 


Cquote2.png






Shen Kuo162





Historian Jonathan Stock notes that the bent bow described in the poem above represents the arched bow used to play the huqin, while the sound of the instrument itself represented the discontent expressed by the prisoners-of-war with their defeated 





khan




.162




Legacy



Praise, critique, and criticism


In the Routledge Curzon Encyclopedia of Confucianism, Xinzhong Yao states that Shen Kuo's legacy was tainted by his eager involvement in Wang Anshi's New Policies reforms, his actions criticized in 







the later traditional histories






.1 However, Shen's reputation as a polymath has been well-regarded. The 



British


 sinologist, historian, and biochemist Joseph Needham (1900 1995) stated that Shen Kuo was  one of the greatest scientific minds in Chinese history. 164 The 






French





 sinologist Jacques Gernet (b. 1921) is of the opinion that Shen possessed an  amazingly modern mind. 165 Yao states of Shen's thorough recording of natural sciences in his Dream Pool Essays:



We must regard Shen Kuo's collection as an indispensable primary source attesting to the unmatched level of attainment achieved by Chinese science prior to the twelfth century.166



However, Toby E. Huff writes that Shen Kuo's  scattered set  of writings lacks clear-cut organization and  theoretical acuteness,  that is, 
scientific theory.167 Nathan Sivin wrote that Shen's originality stands  cheek by jowl with trivial didacticism, court anecdotes, and ephemeral curiosities  that provide little insight.167 Donald Holzman writes that Shen  has nowhere organized his observations into anything like a general theory. 167 Huff writes that this was a systemic problem of early Chinese science, which lacked systematic treatment that could be found in European works such as the Concordance and Discordant Canons by the lawyer 











Gratian










 of 
Bologna (fl. 12th century).167 In regards to an overarching concept of 
science which could branch together all the various sciences studied by the Chinese, Sivin asserts that the writings of Shen Kuo  do not indicate that he achieved, or even sought, an integrated framework for his diverse knowledge; the one common thread is the varied responsibilities of his career as a high civil servant. 168




Burial and posthumous honors


Upon his death, Shen Kuo was interred in a tomb in 
Yuhang District of 

Hangzhou
, at the foot of the Taiping Hill.169 His tomb was eventually destroyed, yet 

Ming Dynasty
 records indicated its location, which was found in 1983 and protected by the government in 1986.169 The remnants of the tomb's brick structure remained, along with Song Dynasty 
glasswares and 
coins.169 The Hangzhou Municipal Committee completed a restoration of Shen's tomb in September 2001. 


In addition to his tomb, Shen Kuo's Mengxi garden estate, his former two acre (8,000 m ) property in Zhenjiang, was restored by the government in 1985.170 However, the renovated Mengxi Garden is only part of the original of Shen Kuo's time.171 A 

Qing Dynasty
 era hall built on the site is now used as the main admissions gate.170 In the Memorial Hall of the gardens, there is a large painting depicting the original garden of Shen Kuo's time, including wells, green bamboo groves, stone-paved paths, and decorated walls of the original halls.171 In this exhibition hall there stands a 1.4 m (4.6 ft) tall statue of Shen Kuo sitting on a platform, along with centuries-old published copies of his Dream Pool Essays in glass cabinets, one of which is from Japan.171 At the garden estate there are also displayed marble banners, statues of Shen Kuo, and a model of an armillary sphere; a small museum gallery depicts Shen's various achievements.170 


The Chinese 




Mount Zijinshan Observatory



 discovered a new 
planetoid in 1964; in 1979, the 





Chinese Academy of Sciences




 decided to honor Shen by listing  Shen Kuo  as one of its names.

Sawfish (SS-276), probably off Hunter's Point Shipyard near San Francisco CA., following an overhaul in late 1943-early 1944.











USS Sawfish (SS-276), a 



Gato-class


 
submarine, was a ship of the 






United States Navy





 named for the 
sawfish, a viviparous 
ray which has a long flat snout with a row of toothlike structures along each edge. It is found principally in the mouths of tropical American and African rivers.


Sawfish (SS-276) was laid down on 
20 January 
1942 by the 
Portsmouth Navy Yard, 

Kittery, Maine
; launched on 
23 June 
1942; sponsored by the Honorable 

Hattie Wyatt Caraway
, the first woman to be elected to the 

United States Senate
; and commissioned on 
26 August 
1942, Lt. Comdr. Eugene T. Sands in command.


After shakedown off 

Portsmouth
, in 



Narragansett Bay


, and en route to the 
Panama Canal the new submarine arrived at 


Pearl Harbor

 on 
21 January 
1943. Ten days later, she got underway for the first of her 10 war patrols.



 First and second war patrols, January   June 1943 



Sawfish proceeded to waters off southwestern 
Japan where she attacked several targets and concluded that she had sunk or damaged some. However, they turned out to be two neutral 



Soviet


 cargo ships, Ilmen and Kola. A careful study of Japanese and American records after the war did not confirm any other sinkings on Sawfish's first war patrol, which ended when she reached 








Midway







 on 
25 March.


The submarine departed Midway on 
15 April and headed for Japan. On 
5 May off the coast of 
Honsh , she sank the converted 
gunboat, Hakkai Maru. A fortnight later, she stalked an enemy task force but lost her quarry in heavy swells. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 
6 June.




 Third war patrol, June   August 1943 



Underway again on the last day of the month, Sawfish set course for the 
East China Sea. On the night of 
21 July, she attacked a 
convoy of nine ships and concluded that she had scored several hits. However, postwar assessment of records was unable to confirm any kills during this attack or during her operations for the next five days. 


Finally, early on the morning of 
27 July, her luck finally changed when she attacked a convoy escorted by a 720-ton minelayer. Comdr. Sands fired a spread of four 
torpedoes from a range of only 750 yards. He went deep as soon as the  fish  were clear and, in less than half a minute, the submarine was jolted by a violent explosion. Fearing that the detonation had been premature, Sands remained deep for over an hour. When he ascended to 
periscope depth, the convoy had escaped, but the escort, coastal minelayer, Hirashima, was sinking. Sawfish returned to Pearl Harbor on 
10 August.




 Fourth and fifth war patrols, September   December 1943 



During her fourth patrol, 
10 September to 
16 October, defective torpedoes frustrated the seven attacks which she made in the 











Sea of Japan










 before she returned to Midway. She got underway for the 


Bonins

 and her fifth patrol on 
1 November. On 
8 December, she sank 3,267-ton passenger-cargo ship, Sansei Maru, and returned to Midway on 
19 December. She soon proceeded to 
Hunter's Point Navy Yard, 

San Francisco, Calif.
, for overhaul.




 Sixth and seventh war patrols, April   August 1944 



Back in top trim, the submarine returned to Pearl Harbor early in the spring. On 
8 April 
1944, she got underway for Japanese waters and her sixth war patrol. However, she only encountered two targets: a cargo ship which she attacked on 
25 April and a second vessel which she sighted four days later too fast and too far away for the submarine to attack. Although the submarine reported scoring two hits on the cargo ship, Japanese records contain no evidence of any sinking in the vicinity of the attack.


During her seventh war patrol, Sawfish joined 
Rock (SS-274) and 
Tilefish (SS-307) for 
wolfpack operations. The submarines sortied from 






Majuro





 on 
22 June and headed for the 

Philippines
. On 
18 July, she damaged a 





tanker




 and, on 
26 June, fired a spread of four torpedoes at surfaced Japanese submarine, 



I-29''


, which exploded and sank. After a fruitless chase of a large Japanese convoy, the wolfpack ended the patrol at Pearl Harbor on 
15 August.




 Eighth war patrol, September   November 1944 



During Sawfish's eighth war patrol, her commanding officer, Comdr. Alan B. Banister, led a wolfpack which included 
Drum (SS-228), 
Icefish (SS-367) and from time to time other submarines. The pack departed Pearl Harbor on 
9 September and headed for waters south of 

Formosa
 where the submarines took a heavy toll on enemy shipping. Sawfish, herself, accounted for 6,521-ton tanker, Tachibana Maru, on 
9 October and 6,838-ton 
seaplane tender, 
Kimikawa Maru'', on 
23 October. 


During the patrol, Sawfish also served on lifeguard station off Formosa in support of 
carrier raids. On 
16 October, she rescued a pilot who had survived four and one-half days at sea in a small rubber boat without food, water, or sunshade. The wolfpack returned to 






Majuro





 on 
8 November.




 Ninth and tenth war patrols, December 1944   April 1945 



Sawfish got underway on 
17 December 
1944 and returned to waters off Formosa where she spent her entire ninth war patrol on lifeguard station. She rescued a pilot on 
21 January 
1945 before heading toward 

Guam
. She reached 
Apra Harbor on 
4 February for refit.


Sawfish sailed on 
10 March for her 10th and last war patrol which she spent on lifeguard station off 
Nansei Shoto supporting air strikes preparing for and covering the 

conquest of Okinawa
. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 
26 April and soon proceeded to San Francisco for overhaul in the 
Bethlehem Steel Company yard there. 




 Post-war service 



She was ready for action and heading toward 

Hawaii
 on 
15 August when hostilities ended. She reached Pearl Harbor on 
22 August but soon headed back to the west coast for duty as a training ship for the West Coast Fleet Sound School. She returned to Hawaii early in 1946, but was back at San Francisco on 
22 March for inactivation. She was decommissioned on 
26 June 
1946 and remained in reserve at 







Mare Island Naval Shipyard






 until May 1947 when she proceeded to 
San Pedro for duty as a Naval Reserve training ship. On 
1 April 
1960, Sawfish was struck from the 
Navy List and scrapped.


Sawfish received eight 
battle stars for service during 







World War II






.






Trivia





 A fictional Sawfish was represented in the film 

On the Beach
 by a 




Royal Navy



 diesel-electric submarine, 
HMS Andrew (P423).

Aguas Santas Ocana Navarro (born 
April 23, 
1963 in 

Brenes
, 










Seville









, 



Spain


) was the first lady of 

Honduras
. Aguas Santas, her double given name, means  
holy waters  in 

Spanish
.  


Marriage and first lady


Ocana Navarro was the wife of former 









President








 









Ricardo Maduro








, marrying him when he was already President in October 2002 after meeting him during a 2 year stint working in the Spanish embassy in 

Tegucigalpa
. She received dual Spanish-Honduran citizenship in 2004.



Working with and adoption of children


She and her husband legally adopted five 
children, two of whom had their families 
murdered but she now has 13 children in her care, all of whom accompanied her to 

Nicaragua
 on 
January 27, 
2006, the day she ceased being first lady. She will work there with Nicaraguan children in need, and will help the wife of Nicaragua's President 
Enrique Bolanos. The five children legally adopted are called Leidy Jackeline, Kevin Josue, Francis, Joan and Jackie.


As first lady of Honduras she was particularly known for her work with 
Street children and visiting 
jailmates. She created a program,  Cero Ninos en las Calles , which is geared towards eliminating children working in Honduras' streets. This program has been severely criticized by her husband's 
political opponents. Ocana Navarro continues fighting for children's rights, by denouncing a 








U.S.







-based organisation that was allegedly involved in the selling of adoptive children by using the 
internet to lure prospective clients.





Domestic life


During 2003, Ocana Navarro returned to live in Spain for a short period of time, sparking rumours that she and her husband were about to 
divorce. The separation was allegedly provoked because Ricardo Maduro named a former girlfriend, Mireya Batres, to be Honduras' Minister of 
Culture. Batres was sacked and she returned. 


In 2004. Ocana Navarro travelled to 

Los Angeles, California
, in the United States, where she befriended 


Tom Cruise

 and 



John Travolta


, celebrity members of the 
Scientology 
religion. She made them promise to pay a visit to Honduras, so that they could raise awareness among Scientologists about the poor conditions in which many Hondurans live. 


When she returned to Spain in 2004 she was pursued by 
paparazzi. She declared that she was there to visit political personalities in order to try to gather 







charitable






 aid for Honduras' poorest from the Spanish government.


In 
December 17,
2005 she protagonized a scandal at the Presidential House of Honduras when her husband, 









Ricardo Maduro








, President of Honduras invited members of the press to a Christmas lunch. Aguas Ocana took the podium and invited the journalist Ninfa Arias to leave the Presidential House because of a dispute they had about an article published on the newspaper (
El Heraldo).


She announced the end of her marriage to Maduro to 
Hola magazine on 
January 25, 
2006, two days before the end of her term as first lady. After that the local press has referred to her as a gold digger.

Elizur Goodrich (
March 24, 
1761 - 
November 1, 
1849) was an American lawyer and politician from 

Connecticut
.

Born in

, he was the son of Elizur Goodrich.  He graduated from

Federalist 
elector for President, supporting Federalist candidate 



John Adams


 against

.  He was elected to represent Connecticut At-Large to the 
Sixth and 
Seventh Congresses, but only served in the Sixth (
March 4, 
1799 to 
March 3, 
1801) because President John Adams appointed him collector of customs for the Port of New Haven.  After his removal by Adams' successor, President Thomas Jefferson, Goodrich was elected to the Governor's Council in Connecticut, serving until 1818.


He taught law at Yale from 1801 to 1810 and was

Cities, towns and villages in Espirito Santo State





Coordinates: 
19 13 30 S 40 51 03 W  /  -19.225, -40.85083
Pancas is a 

Brazilian
 municipality in the state of 
Espirito Santo. Its population was 20,025 (2005) and its area is 824 km .1

It is situated on a tributary of the 



Doce River


, in the northwest of the state. Locally it is known as a good spot for 
paragliding.



History


Before the European colonizers arrived, the area was inhabited by 
Amerindians. The first European settlers founded a village called Sao Silvano, but that was destroyed by the local Amerindians. The first permanent residents arrived in 1918 looking for valuable minerals, but the region of the Doce River was practically uninhabited till 1925, it was then that the first bridge over the Doce River was built, called Florian Avidos Bridge, and this brought more people into the north of the state for the first time. The bridge primarily opened access to logging companies which brought more people and coffee plantations, opening their way to the valley where Pancas is situated. The first settlement in the area was founded in 1925, and was called Nossa Senhora Da Penha.

Race summary


The 






McLaren





 of 




Ayrton Senna



 led from the start, whilst his teammate 




Alain Prost



 had a poor start and dropped to 6th place. Whilst he was able to recover these places, he could not catch Senna who controlled the gap according to the traffic. Maintaining a lead of 6-10 seconds, Senna slowed on the last lap reducing the gap to 2.3 seconds at the line.







Nelson Piquet



 battled with an underpowered 






Lotus





 to maintain 3rd place ahead of a train of cars. He was lucky to make it to the finish line as the extra boost needed to keep the position cut severely into his fuel quota.




Nigel Mansell
 made a superb drive from a poor 11th place on the grid to be up to 3rd place by lap 40 before retiring due to a faulty voltage regulator.







Thierry Boutsen



's 






Benetton





 came home in 4th ahead of 




Gerhard Berger



 in the 








Ferrari







 and rounding out the points was 




Alessandro Nannini



. He had been fighting for 3rd place with Piquet, but despite being consistently closer in the corners, he had to yield to the Lotus' superior power on the straights. They tangled and Nannini dropped to 7th, but put in the fastest atmospheric lap to climb to 5th. He had to settle for 6th after Berger drove him onto the grass at the 
Acqua Minerale chicane.

Lillian Masediba Ngoyi  Ma Ngoyi , (
1911 - 
13 March, 
1980), was a 

South African
 anti-apartheid activist. She was the first woman elected to the executive committee of the 

African National Congress
, and helped launch the 
Federation of South African Women. 

Ngoyi joined the ANC Women's League in 1952; she was at that stage a widow with two children and an elderly mother to support, and worked as a seamstress. A year later she was elected as President of the Women's League. On 
August 9 
1956 Ngoyi led a march along with 






Helen Joseph





, 






Albertina Sisulu





, and 











Sophia Williams-De Bruyn










 of 20,000 women to the 





Union Buildings




 of 

Pretoria
 in protest against the 
apartheid government requiring women to carry passbooks as part of the 
pass laws. Ngoyi was not an intellectual, rather she was known as a strong orator and a fiery inspiration to many of her colleagues in the ANC. She was arrested in 1956, spent 71 days in solitary confinement, and was for a period of 11 years placed under severe bans and restrictions that often confined to her home in 





Orlando, Soweto




. A community health centre in Soweto is named in her honour. 


On 
August 9, 
2006, the 50th anniversary of the march on Pretoria, Strijdom Square from which the women marched, was renamed Lilian Ngoyi Square. August 9th is commemorated in South Africa as 
Women's Day.

Arminas Narbekovas (born 
November 28, 
1965 in 
Garg dai) is a former 



Lithuanian


 
football player. In November 2003, to celebrate UEFA's jubilee, he was selected by the 
Lithuanian Football Federation as the country's 



Golden Player


 - the greatest player of the last 50 years. 
http://www.uefa.com/uefa/news/Kind=256/newsId=130150.html He is currently the chairman of 
FK  algiris Vilnius.


Narbekovas made his debut in 1983 with  algiris Vilnius, Lithuania's sole representative in the 
Soviet Elite League, at the age of 18. In 1987, he finished second in league scoring with 16 goals while leading his club to a third-place finish, their best in history. Zalgiris would then participate in the 

UEFA Cup
 for the first time, losing to 


Austria Vienna

. 

Austria
 would become Narbekovas' destination after Lithuanian players were allowed to move abroad. Arminas moved there in 1990 after a short stint with 
Lokomotiv Moscow, since Lithuania was not a part of 

UEFA
 yet and players from its clubs were not permitted to transfer. Narbekovas would spend the rest of his club career in Austria, with Austria Vienna until 1995 and then with 
Admira Wacker and a number of other lower division clubs.


Narbekovas was named Lithuania's footballer of the year four times, from 1985 to 1988. Although he never received a FIFA-sanctioned cap for the 

USSR national team
, he did play for them, and win the Gold Medal, at the 
1988 Summer Olympics. Narbekovas scored two goals in the tournament, including an 
extra time one in the semifinals against 

Italy
, helping the Soviets to a 3-2 victory. Arminas first played for 

Lithuania
 in its first ever game as a newly independent country, on 
May 27, 
1990 against 

Georgia
, and scored the first goal in the 2-2 tie. Unfortunately, injuries limited his career to just 13 caps and four goals for his country.

Christianity portal





Christian worldview refers to a collection of distinctively Christian philosophical and religious beliefs.  The term is typically used in one of three ways:



 A set of worldviews voiced by those identifying themselves as Christian;


 Common elements of worldviews predominant among those identifying themselves as Christian;


 The concept of a single  Christian worldview  on a range of issues.





Background



The Multiplicity of Biblical Worldviews



Just as there are various translations of the 
Bible accepted as canon, there are varieties of Christian worldviews and even disputes of the meaning of the concept of a Christian worldview.  This worldview definition and concept has changed with the canons: for example, the concept of a  three-story  universe is in several versions of the 
Bible - the heavens above, the earth beneath, and the underworld - what 




















Northrop Frye



















 indicated as the central clusters of the system of metaphors in the Bible - mountain, garden, and cave.  Later Bibles include the notion of Hell to accommodate the emergence of this concept in 
Christian belief.  


In other respects than the  three-story  universe, there are great differences among the biblical worldviews, including pre-Christian changes in the 



Torah


.  The Sadducean community to which most Temple priests belonged in the time of 



















Jesus


















 accepted only the first five books of the 



Torah


 as canon.  The various schools of Pharisees accepted different sets of books.


The Evangelical Worldview is built upon the outline: Creation -- gt; Fall -- gt; Redemption -- gt; Consummation.




Worldviews Are A Universal of Human Existence



Worldviews embrace the world as it exists in one's time, but only in relation to how the world is pictured by this or that person, this or that community or institution, tainted by possible agenda. A religious worldview can not only describe the beliefs and agenda of a group, but the style and tone of that worldview can reflect a general emotional state of those who speak for that group.  For example, Christian worldviews reflected in British 19th Century Imperialist doctrine can strike the contemporary reader as patronizing and 
magnanimous in tone, reflecting both the need to reinforce the higher moral purpose of British hegemony but the largesse that the British Empire received from implementing this worldview.




Language Factors in Worldviews: the Case of Palestine in Jesus' Day



Another worldview factor has to do with language.  It is the Greek 





Septuagint




 that is quoted by Paul in his Letters in the New Testament, not the 



Torah


 in any of its differing canonizations.  
Aramaic by this time was spoken mostly among the poor of Palestine.  The Greek-speaking synagogues of Jerusalem and other large cities were well attended by Christians like Stephen the Martyr, Jews native to Jerusalem and other parts of Palestine and pilgrims and converts who spoke mostly Greek.  




U.S. Protestant Conservative  Worldview  vs.  Doctrine 



The U.S. use of the term  worldview  in Christian rhetoric can be traced to the evangelical Reformed philosopher 










H. Evan Runner









 of 

Calvin College
 in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Runner used the term in his evangelical Reformed community in North America, promoting the worldview concept from a philosophical concept to a synonym for  doctrine.   Different denominations of Christianity have varying worldviews.

IT qualifications
Apple Inc. services




Apple Certified System Administrator (ACSA) is an 
Apple, Inc. designed 
certification program to verify an in-depth knowledge of Apple technical architecture.

An ACSA will have demonstrated the ability to install and configure Mac OS X systems, as well as the ability to design and configure networks; enable, customize, tune, and troubleshoot a wide range of services; and integrate 
Mac OS X, 
Mac OS X Server, and other Apple technologies within a multi-platform networked environment.


The ACSA is currently available for 

Mac OS X v10.4
 and 

Xsan
 Administration, as the 

Mac OS X v10.3
 test was phased out in December 2005.


For OS X 10.4, the ACSA program has been revised to focus on individual job functions.  ACSA exams are now elective and the certification program can be structured to meet the needs of the individual.  Each passed exam earns a specialization certificate and a specific number of credits towards the ACSA certification.  When a candidate accumulates a total of seven certification credits, certification is granted.


To achieve an ACSA, new candidates may take any of the following exams to earn the seven required certification credits:



Mac OS X Deployment v10.4 Exam (9L0-609) -- 2 credits


Xsan Administration v1.1 Exam (9L0-610) -- 3 credits


Directory Services Integration and Administration v10.4 Exam (9L0-611) -- 4 credits


Security Best Practices v10.4 Exam (9L0-612) -- 3 credits


Podcasting and Streaming Internet Media Exam (9L0-613) -- 3 credits


Command Line Setup and Administration v10.4 Exam (9L0-614) -- 3 credits


Network Account Management v10.4 Exam (9L0-615) -- 3 credits


Xsan for Pro Video Technician v10.4 Exam (9L0-932) -- 3 credits




For update certification, persons who are already ACSA certified for OS X 10.3 are automatically certified for the new ACSA program.  Certification will expire for these individuals two years after the date the ACSA 10.3 exams were taken.  The candidate will then need to replace expired credits with the new ACSA elective exams to maintain the required seven credits.


To move on to the 
Apple Certified Trainer is a much bigger deal.  To become an ACSA you do not actually have to take any courses, but instead just pass the tests.  Some do not need the courses to pass the tests.  To become an Apple Certified Trainer, you must take the course, pass the test with a 90% or better and take a train-the-trainer class.

Christchurch International Airport





Air New Zealand Flight 901 (TE901) was a scheduled 
Antarctic sightseeing flight from 
Auckland International Airport in New Zealand. The Antarctic sightseeing flights were operated with 

McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30
 aircraft and began in February 1977. On 28 November 1979 the 14th flight crashed into 







Mount Erebus






, killing all 237 passengers and 20 crewmembers aboard.


 Background 


The flight was designed and marketed as a unique sightseeing experience, carrying an experienced Antarctic guide who pointed out scenic features and landmarks using the aircraft public-address system. Passengers enjoyed a low-flying sweep of 



McMurdo Sound


, returning to New Zealand the same day.1

London Heathrow Airport
 in 1977



Dignitaries such as 
Sir Edmund Hillary had acted as guides on previous flights. Sir Edmund was scheduled to act as the guide for the fatal flight, but had to cancel due to other commitments. His long-time friend and climbing companion, 
Peter Mulgrew, stood in as guide. 


The flights usually operated at about 85% of capacity; the empty seats, usually the centre ones, allowed passengers to move more easily about the cabin to look out of the windows.


The aircraft that day was a DC-10-30, registered ZK-NZP, which had been delivered to Air New Zealand in December 1974. The plane itself had an unblemished flying record, and was utilized by Air New Zealand for its long-haul routes.




 Accident 



 Circumstances surrounding the accident 


Captain Jim Collins and co-pilot Greg Cassin had never flown to Antarctica before, but they were experienced pilots and the flight was considered a simple one. On 9 November 1979, 19 days before departure, the two pilots had attended a briefing in which they were shown a 
flight plan used by previous pilots on flights to Antarctica. The plan gave coordinates for the trip including a scenic detour around McMurdo Sound. These coordinates, when entered into the plane's computer, automatically directed the plane through the flight.1


At that time flight plan coordinates were entered into the computer by hand, and during this process a single digit had been typed incorrectly. This resulted in the flight plan, originally intended to fly down the middle of the wide McMurdo Sound,  actually being programmed to fly directly over 







Mount Erebus






, some miles to the east.




 Changes to the coordinates and departure 


Collins and Cassin input the coordinates into the plane's computer before they departed at 8.21 a.m. 
NZDT (1921 GMT, November 27) from 
Auckland International Airport. The flight was supposed to arrive back in Auckland at 6.09 p.m.2 Unknown to them, the coordinates had been modified earlier that morning to correct the error introduced years previously and undetected until now. These new coordinates changed the flight plan to fly 45 kilometres (28 miles) east of where the pilots intended the plane to fly. The coordinates instructed the plane to fly over 
Lewis Bay and directly over Mount Erebus, a 3,794 m (12,448 ft) high 
volcano, instead of over McMurdo Sound.1


About four hours after a smooth take-off the flight was 70 kilometres (42 miles) away from 
McMurdo Station. The radio communications centre there allowed the pilots to descend to 10,000 ft (3,050 m) and to continue  visually.  Air safety regulations at the time did not allow flights to descend to lower than 6,000 ft (1,830 m), even in good weather, although Air New Zealand's own travel magazine showed photographs of previous flights clearly operating below 6,000 ft (1,800 m).  Collins believed the plane was over open water.1




 Collision with Mount Erebus

Collins told McMurdo Station that he would be dropping to 2,000 ft (610 m), at which point he switched control of the aircraft to the automated computer system. At the time there was a layer of cloud that blended with the white of the volcano, forming a 
sector whiteout - there was no contrast between the two to warn the pilots. The effect was to fool all on the flight deck into thinking that the white mountainside was the Ross Ice Shelf, a huge expanse of floating ice derived from the great ice sheets of Antarctica, which was in fact now behind the mountain. Air New Zealand had provided no training for the flight crew on the sector whiteout phenomenon as it was little understood, even by experienced polar pilots.


At 12.49 p.m., the 
Ground Proximity Warning System began sounding a warning that the plane was dangerously close to terrain. Although Collins immediately requested go-around power, 3 there was no time to divert the aircraft and six seconds later the plane 
collided with the side of Mount Erebus and disintegrated, instantly killing all on board. The pilot did not pull vigorously on the control column as a reflex to seeing imminent death, instead he raised the nose of the aircraft 15  as rehearsed in training - it would then seem likely they never recognised their perfect white view as a mountain. Most of the aircraft was smashed into small pieces, with the exception of the 
empennage. The wreckage burned vigorously in a pool of jet fuel, with much material sinking into the melted ice, which later re-froze.


McMurdo Station attempted to contact the flight after the crash, and informed Air New Zealand headquarters in Auckland that communication with the plane had been lost. United States search and rescue personnel were placed on standby.1




 Search and discovery 


At 1:00 p.m. the 






United States Navy





 released a situation report, stating:




Air New Zealand Flight 901 has failed to acknowledge radio transmissions. ... One 
LC-130 fixed wing aircraft and two 

UH-1N
 rotary wing aircraft are preparing to launch for 
SAR effort.4


Data gathered at 3:43 p.m. were added to the situation report, stating that the visibility was 40 miles (64 km). It also stated that six aircraft had been launched to find the flight.5


At 10:00 p.m., about half an hour after the plane would have run out of fuel, Air New Zealand informed the press that it believed the aircraft to be lost. Rescue teams searched along the assumed flight path, but found nothing. At 12:55 a.m. the crew of a 






United States Navy





 plane discovered unidentified debris along the side of Mount Erebus.6 No survivors could be seen. Twenty hours after the crash, helicopters with search parties managed to land on the side of the mountain. It was confirmed that the wreckage was that of flight 901 and that all 237 passengers and 20 crewmembers had been killed. The aircraft's altitude at the time of the collision was 445 metres (1,465 ft).


Efforts for recovery were extensive, owing in part to the pressure from Japan, as 24 passengers had been Japanese. The operation lasted until 9 December 1979, with up to 60 recovery workers on site at a time. The 
vertical stabilizer section of the plane, with the 
koru intact, was seen in the snow 
http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/media/photo/tail-of-air-nz-plane-at-erebus. Bodies and fragments of the aircraft were flown back to Auckland.7 The remains of 44 of the victims were not individually identified, and the funeral for them was held on 22 February 1980.

Operation Overdue 1979


A team of 

New Zealand Police
 officers and a 
Mountain Face Rescue team were dispatched on a 




No 40 Squadron



 

C-130 Hercules
 aircraft.


The job of individual identification took many weeks and was largely done by teams of pathologists, dentists and police. The mortuary team was led by Inspector Jim Morgan, who collated and edited a report on the recovery operation. Record keeping had to be meticulous because of the number and fragmented state of the human remains that had to be identified to the satisfaction of the 
coroner. From a purely technical point of view the exercise was both innovative and highly successful, with 83% of the deceased eventually being identified, sometimes from evidence such as a finger capable of yielding a print, or keys in a pocket.



The fact that we all spent about a week camped in 
polar tents amid the wreckage and dead bodies, maintaining a 24 hour work schedule says it all. We split the men into two shifts (12 hours on and 12 off), and recovered with great effort all the human remains at the site. Many bodies were trapped under tons of fuselage and wings and much physical effort was required to dig them out and extract them.


Initially, there was very little water at the site and we had only one bowl between all of us to wash our hands in before eating. The water was black. In the first days on site we did not wash plates and utensils after eating but handed them on to the next shift because we were unable to wash them. I could not eat my first meal on site because it was a meat stew. Our polar clothing became covered in black human grease (a result of burns on the bodies).


We felt relieved when the first resupply of woollen gloves arrived because ours had become saturated in human grease, however, we needed the finger movement that 
wool gloves afforded, i.e. writing down the details of what we saw and assigning body and grid numbers to all body parts and labeling them. All bodies and body parts were photographed in situ by 
U.S. Navy 
photographers who worked with us. Also, U.S. Navy personnel helped us to lift and pack bodies into body bags which was very exhausting work.


Later, the 
Skua 
gulls were eating the bodies in front of us, causing us much mental anguish as well as destroying the chances of identifying the corpses. We tried to shoo them away but to no avail, we then threw flares, also to no avail. Because of this we had to pick up all the bodies/parts that had been bagged and create 11 large piles of human remains around the crash site in order to bury them under snow to keep the birds off. To do this we had to scoop up the top layer of snow over the crash site and bury them, only later to uncover them when the weather cleared and the helos were able to get back on the site. It was immensely exhausting work.  


After we had almost completed the mission, we were trapped by bad weather and isolated. At that point, NZPO2 and I allowed the liquor that had survived the crash to be given out and we had a party (macabre, but we had to let off steam).


We ran out of cigarettes, a catastrophe that caused all persons, civilians and Police on site, to hand in their personal supplies so we could dish them out equally and spin out the supply we had. As the weather cleared, the helos were able to get back and we then were able to hook the piles of bodies in cargo nets under the 
helicopters and they were taken to McMurdo. This was doubly exhausting because we also had to wind down the personnel numbers with each helo load and that left the remaining people with more work to do. It was exhausting uncovering the bodies and loading them and dangerous too as debris from the crash site was whipped up by the helo rotors. Risks were taken by all those involved in this work. The civilians from 

McDonnell Douglas
, MOT and US Navy personnel were first to leave and then the Police and 
DSIR followed. I am proud of my service and those of my colleagues on 







Mount Erebus

  Jim Morgan


The last searchers off the mountain were Sergeant Mark Penn and Constable Al Windleburn and several DSIR personnel, after a final 36 hours non-stop shift. When this group got back to  Mac Town  
McMurdo Station, they were met by the U.S. Navy Fire Crew who told them to strip naked and jump into the (heated) firehouse water tank. 


In 1979 the 
post traumatic stress suffered by the body recovery and identification teams was recognised, some of whom broke down under their grim duty. Counselling was offered to all who wished it, and the debriefing report specifically noted the need for officers in command of such operations to know how to recognise and deal with the signs of stress in staff. It took several years more for 
psychological support to become standard practice in the 

New Zealand Police
.


There was no official group recognition for the efforts of the police involved on this occasion, but Inspector R. S. Mitchell, leader of the body recovery team, and Inspector Morgan, leader of the DVI team, were awarded the 
OBE for their services in relation to this disaster.


In 2006 the New Zealand Special Service Medal (Erebus) was instituted to recognise the service of New Zealanders, and citizens of the United States of America and other countries, who were involved in the body recovery, identification and crash investigation phases of Operation Overdue.

 Official accident report 


The accident report compiled by New Zealand's chief inspector of air accidents, 

Ron Chippindale
, was released on 12 June 1980. It cited 
pilot error as the principal cause of the accident and attributed blame to the decision of Collins to descend below the customary minimum altitude level, and continue at that height when the crew was unsure of the plane's position. The customary minimum altitude prohibited descent below 6,000 ft (1,830 m) even under good weather conditions, but a combination of factors led the captain to believe the plane was over the sea (the middle of McMurdo Sound and few small low islands), and previous flight 901 pilots had regularly flown low over the area to give passengers a better view, as evidenced by photographs in Air New Zealand's own travel magazine and by first-hand accounts of personnel based on the ground at NZ's Scott Base.




 Mahon Inquiry 


In response to public demand, the 
New Zealand Government announced a further one-man 
Royal Commission of Inquiry into the accident, to be performed by the highly respected judge 






Justice Peter Mahon





.


Mahon's report, released on 27 April 1981, cleared the crew of blame for the disaster. Mahon said the single, dominant and effective cause of the crash was the changing of the aircraft's navigation computer co-ordinates to route the aircraft directly towards Mount Erebus without the crew being advised. The new flight plan took the aircraft directly at the mountain, rather than along its flank. Due to 
whiteout conditions,  a malevolent trick of the polar light , the crew were unable to visually identify the mountain in front of them. Furthermore, they may have experienced a rare meteorological phenomenon called 
sector whiteout which creates the visual illusion of a flat horizon far in the distance (it appeared to be a very broad gap between cloud layers allowing a view of the distant Ross Ice Shelf and beyond). Mahon noted that the flight crew, with many thousands of hours of flight time between them, had considerable experience with the extreme accuracy of the aircraft's 
inertial navigation system. Mahon also found that the radio communications centre at 
McMurdo Station had authorised Collins to descend to 1,500 ft (450 m), below the minimum safe level.


In para. 377 of his report, Mahon controversially claimed airline executives and senior (management) pilots engaged in a 
conspiracy to whitewash the inquiry, famously accusing them of  an orchestrated litany of lies  by covering up evidence and lying to investigators. Mahon found that in the original report Chippendale had a poor grasp of the flying involved in jet airline operation, as he (and the New Zealand CAA in general) was typically involved in investigating simple light aircraft crashes. Chippendale's investigation techniques were revealed as lacking in rigour, allowing for errors and avoidable gaps in knowledge to occur in reports. Consequently Chippendale entirely missed the importance of the flight plan change and the rare meteorological conditions of Antarctica. Had the pilots been informed of the flight plan change, the crash would have been avoided.




 Appeals 


Air New Zealand appealed against Mahon's findings to the Court of Appeal, which set aside the costs order against the airline. Mahon in turn appealed to the 
Privy Council in London. His findings as to the cause of the accident, namely reprogramming of the aircraft's flight plan by the ground crew who then failed to inform the flight crew, had not been challenged before the Court of Appeal, and so were not challenged before the 
Privy Council. His conclusion that the crash was the result of the aircrew being misdirected as to their flight path, not due to pilot error, therefore remained. But the Board held that Mahon had acted in excess of his jurisdiction and in breach of natural justice by going on to make findings of a conspiracy by Air New Zealand to cover up the errors of the ground staff. In their judgment, delivered on 20 October 1982, the Law Lords dismissed Mahon's appeal and upheld the decision of the Court of Appeal. Aviation researcher John King wrote in his book New Zealand Tragedies, Aviation:




They demolished his case (Mahon's case for a cover-up) item by item, including Exhibit 164 which they said could not  be understood by any experienced pilot to be intended for the purposes of navigation  and went even further, saying there was no clear proof on which to base a finding that a plan of deception, led by the company's chief executive, had ever existed.


 Exhibit 164  was a photocopied diagram of McMurdo Sound showing a southbound flight path passing west of 









Ross Island








 and a northbound path passing the island on the east. The diagram did not extend sufficiently far south to show where, how, or even if they joined, and left the two paths disconnected. Evidence had been given to the effect that the diagram had been included in the flight crew's briefing documentation.





 Legacy of the disaster 


The crash of flight 901 remains one of New Zealand's two deadliest disasters, along with the 
Napier earthquake. A wooden cross was erected above 





Scott Base




 to commemorate the accident. It was replaced in 1986 with an 
aluminium cross after the original was eroded by low temperatures, wind and moisture.


Almost all of the aircraft's wreckage still lies where it came to rest on the slopes of Mount Erebus, under a layer of snow and ice. During warm periods, when snow recedes, it is still visible from the air.


For failing to deliver the result Prime Minister 


Robert Muldoon

 expected, 






Mahon





 remains something of a controversial public hero.


A 
television 
miniseries, , focusing on the investigation and the Royal Commission of Inquiry, was broadcast in New Zealand and Australia in 1988.


The phrase  an orchestrated litany of lies  has entered New Zealand popular culture.91011




In the New Zealand Queen's Birthday Honours list in June 2007 Captain Gordon Vette was awarded the ONZM (Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit), recognising his services in assisting Justice Mahon during the Erebus Inquiry. Vette's book, Impact Erebus, provides a commentary of the flight, its crash and the subsequent investigations.


The registration of the crashed aircraft, ZK-NZP, has not been reissued.

Excession




''




In the 
Culture novels by 


Iain Banks

, the GCU Grey Area is a 
General Contact Unit (a self-aware spaceship dedicated to the task of exploring the universe and interacting with other species) of the fictional 













Culture












 society that has turned 
eccentric. It is described in the novel 





Excession




 and has the dubious honour of being one of the few Culture ships to not to be listed in official records by its chosen name.

The Grey Area has a fascination with 
war, 
genocide and 
pain and the methods of inflicting it. Its interior is a museum containing devices that inflict pain and documents detailing their use. The ship has been described in reviews as  psychopathically righteous ,1 and as a good example of Banks' not letting technological terms and SF-staples stand in the way of describing interesting characters.2


The main reason Grey Area is despised by its peers is that it has chosen to ignore the Culture's 
taboo on non-consensual mindreading. It is for this reason that the ship is more commonly known among the other Culture Minds as Meatfucker.2 In the novel 





Look to Windward




 it is explained that the denial of a Culture Mind's chosen name is viewed as a grave insult and mark of disapproval by its peers.



In Excession''



During the events of 





Excession




, the Grey Area pauses its historical research into a very comprehensive incident of 
genocide to help deliver 
Byr Genar-Hofoen to the 
GSV 
Sleeper Service. It travels within the Sleeper Service to the excession, and near the end of events appears to allow itself to crash into the energy grid near the excession and is presumed by the Culture to have been destroyed, though this is not the case, with the ship obviously having transcended some sort of boundary between universes or else having been assimilated into another consciousness.

Wolverhampton
 school teacher and 
Rugby Union 
full-back Sam Doble may have only won three caps for his country, but he was one of the game's most popular characters and his tragically early death in 1977 at the age of 33 was mourned throughout English rugby. Sam first came to public attention when he scored an astonishing 581 points for 

Moseley
 in the 1971/72 domestic season, an achievement that earned him an 

England
 call up. His debut was one to remember, an 18-9 victory over 

South Africa
 in 

Johannesburg
, against a side that were considered to be the unofficial World Champions. England were on the back foot early on when they lost prop 







Brian 'Stack' Stevens






 to injury and had to contest seven man scrums for twenty minutes. However, the visiting side's makeshift front row did not lose one strike against the head and England gradually took control of the game when Stevens returned. With the forwards keeping the Springboks at bay, Doble scored four penalties and converted Alan Morley's second half try from the touchline to help England to a most unlikely victory. Despite his heroics in South Africa, Sam was destined to play in just two more matches, a 10-0 loss to 

New Zealand
 early in 1973 and a 25-9 loss to 

Wales
 in the following 

Five Nations
 campaign. England were outscored by five tries to nil, but Sam did manage to sign off his international account with two penalties to augment a drop goal by Dick Cowman. Then, just four years later, at around 4.30pm when referees around the country were blowing their whistles, Sam died of a rare form of lymphatic cancer. His life was honoured with a special match between the Rugby Writers International XV and Moseley later in the year, and he is still fondly remembered by all those who knew him. Thirty years on, the victorious England side of 
Ellis Park '72 met up at

Samuel Adler (b. 


Worms

, 

Germany
, 
December 3, 
1809; d. 

New York City
, 
June 9, 
1891) was a leading 

German
-








American







 
Reform 
rabbi, 
Talmudist, and author.  He was also the father of 
Felix Adler, the well-known founder of the 
Society for Ethical Culture.

Adler received his early 

religious education
 from his father Isaac, who was one of the associate rabbis in Worms and instructed him in 

Hebrew
 and the 
Biblical and 
Rabbinic literature of the 
Jews.  When Rabbi Isaac Adler died on 
December 23, 
1822, thirteen year old Samuel, his four young siblings, and their mother were left in straitened circumstances.  In spite of innumerable difficulties and extreme privation, Samuel continued his studies at the 
yeshivot in 


Worms

 and 
Frankfurt-am-Main, while concurrently pursuing a regular course of 
classical and general studies at the high schools of those cities.


After graduating from the Frankfurt 





Gymnasium




, Adler entered, in 1831, the 

University of Bonn
 and later that of 
GieSen, where he was awarded the 


Doctor of Philosophy

 in 1836.  Adler assumed his first official appointment as a preacher and assistant rabbi in Worms.  In 1842, he was elected rabbi of the Jewish congregations in 

Alzey
 and remained in this position until 1857.


At the beginning of 1857, Adler received an offer from 





Temple Emanu-El




, 

New York
 to succeed Dr. L. Merzbacher, recently deceased, as the head rabbi of the leading 
Reform congregation in America.  Adler accepted the call and moved to New York in March 1857.  He remained active as the spiritual head of Emanu-El until 1874, when he was made rabbi emeritus and relieved from active work for the rest of his life.  He was succeeded by 

Gustav Gottheil
.  During his tenure, Adler continued the practice of conducting Temple services in 

German
, in preference to the traditional 

Hebrew
, for the congregation that consisted mostly of prosperous German immigrant families.  Adler also revised the German prayer book introduced by Merzbacher.


Samuel Adler was not merely a thorough 
Talmudic scholar, but also had a prodigious command of the entire scope of knowledge concerning the Jews, including their 



history


, 
religion, and literature.  Adler was committed to translating his scholarship into social action.


During the twenty-one years of his career in Germany, he campaigned energetically for the 
emancipation of the Jews from their civil disabilities, especially for the removal of the humiliating and obnoxious oath known as the 
more judaico.  Adler succeeded in having the Jewish religion taught on equal terms with 
Protestantism and 
Catholicism in the lower and higher schools of Worms.  He pushed for the recognition of 

 gender equality
 within Judaism.  It was through his influence that the 
mechitza, which had segregated the women from the men in the ancient 
synagogue of Worms, was leveled, allowing the sexes to sit with each other during services.


Adler gave special attention to the improvement of the religious instruction of the young, both in the city and in the rural schools he supervised.  He made it his aim to enhance the order, the solemnity, and the dignity of the public worship.  He was instrumental in founding a number of new 
charitable institutions. Above all, with patience and zeal, he persuaded his congregations to let go of the deadening influence of religious literalism. In this endeavor he frequently drew upon the storehouse of his great Talmudic learning for the arguments which he used in his struggle for progress, seeking always to rest the reformation of manners upon a basis of inward conviction, and favoring a gradual transformation rather than an abrupt transition from the old to the new. 


He belonged to what may be called the 
historico-critical school of Jewish theology.  He contributed scholarly articles to several learned periodicals; for example,  Contributions to the History of Sadduceeism,   Jewish Conference Papers ,  Benedictions . Some of these the author collected and published under the Hebrew title,  Kobez 'al Yad  (Collections) in 1886, mainly as a souvenir for his friends. His extensive library of rabbinica was donated by his family to 

Hebrew Union College
, 
Cincinnati.

Eponym


C.H.D. Buys Ballot




Buys-Ballot is an oddly-shaped 
lunar 
crater that is located on the 
far side of the 
Moon. It lies just to the northwest of the small 
lunar mare named 

Lacus Luxuriae
, and southeast of the crater 


Freundlich

. Other nearby craters of note are 


Anderson

 to the southwest and 


Dante

 to the northeast.

This formation has a distinctive shape for a crater, having a prominent extension to the south that nearly doubles the dimension compared to the width across the maximum west-east cross-section. It vaguely resembles a pear, with the thinner end to the south and the bulge to the north. Despite the odd shape, this crater has not been significantly eroded and only a few tiny craterlets mark the interior or the rim.


Running down the middle of the crater along its longest dimension is a ridge that divises the southern part in half. This ridge extends as far north as the widest part before coming to an end. The floor at this widest part has been partially resurfaced by 
basaltic 
lava, leaving an oval area around the northern edge of the central ridge surrounded by a patch of material with a lower 
albedo than the surroundings. The remainder of the interior floor is somewhat rough and irregular, particularly in the southern half.


Attached to the northern end of the crater is another odd formation consisting of the satellite craters Buys-Ballot Y and Z. These two nearly resemble mirror images of each other, being joined down the center by a narrow ridge line and extending nearly twice as far to the north than their individual widths in the east-west direction. The main difference between the two is that there is a concentric formation at the north end of the crater Y. The interior surfaces of both craters are irregular.



Satellite craters


By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater mid-point that is closest to Buys-Ballot.

The Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards logo



The Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards is an annual contest put forth by 

Lucasfilm
 and 
AtomFilms to showcase and acknowledge the growing genre of 
fan films made by, for, and about fans of the 








Star Wars







 saga. The inaugural contest in 2002 was the first time Lucasfilm had officially sanctioned the genre. Since 2007, the contest has been called the Star Wars Fan Movie Challenge.



 Awards 





The Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards trophy






 Rules 


A number of guidelines ensure that entries are produced by amateurs and do not infringe on Lucasfilm properties. The contest limits the content of entries to short film and video 
parodies, 
mockumentaries, and 
documentaries of the Star Wars universe and fan experience. Until 2007, In-universe 
fan fiction-type stories were not allowed. Rules changed in 2007 after all Star Wars movies have been released and fan fiction is now allowed. The contest imposes a time limit on entries - for the inaugural contest, it was 30 minutes, but this was lowered to 15 for the 2003-2005 contests. For 2006 and 2007, the time limit was lowered again to 10 minutes. Entries must not contain nudity, excessive swearing, explicit sexual themes or graphic violence. In addition, no unlicensed copyrighted material may be used in the entries, with the exception of a collection of 
approved images, music and sound effects. For 2006 onward, the contest rules were revised to prohibit contributions by 
union members.




 Presentation 


The awards have been presented at ceremonies held at either 

Comic-Con International
 or Lucas  





Star Wars Celebration




 conventions. For the first contest in 2002, 
Kevin Smith hosted a special on the 
SciFi Channel to showcase the winners and some finalists. Winning films have be shown online at starwars.com, atom.com, and some have appeared on 
SpikeTV. In October 2008, a selction of winning films will be shown in a special Star Wars Fan Movie Challenge themed episode of 
Atom TV on 

Comedy Central
.




 Categories 


The contest s grand prize is the 


George Lucas

 Selects Award, which is presented to the film Lucas himself selects as his favorite. The Audience Choice Award is selected by the worldwide internet audience, as all contest finalists are available to view 
online at Atom.com. The Pioneer Award is given to a film that either defined, changed, or influenced the genre. Other awards are given by a jury of people selected from employees of Atom.com and Lucasfilm. Beginning in 2004, some of the major awards were sponsored by Lucasfilm licensees.

Old Melbourne Gaol

1926

1841







The Old Melbourne Gaol is a 
museum and former 
prison located in 





Russell Street




, 

Melbourne
, 




Victoria



, 

Australia
. Currently it consists of a bluestone building and courtyard and is located next to the old City Police Station and City Courts buildings (both now occupied by 

RMIT University
).



 History 


A land allotment of scrub to the north-east of the town was selected as 
Port Philip's first permanent gaol.  It was modelled on 
Pentonville Prison, 

England
, building of the first Gaol began during 1841 and gradually enlarged and changed until 1864.  1845 the wall ended and the outside dirt track became Russell Street.  1848 superintendent of the gaol was Samuel Barrow.  
Gold rush crimes from 1851 saw a need to enlarge the prison.  A second cell block, an extension on the north side of the original, was erected beginning 1852 and finished by 1858.  


During the 1850s decade one woman hanged was Elizabeth Scott along with 59 men.  The second jail was publicly tendered 25th May 1882 for a west wing extension to hold female prisoners and was won by British prison engineer 

Joshua Jebb
.


The 
bluestone walls with turret watchtowers were completed by 1864 and then demolished during the 
Great Depression of the 1930s to create a sea retaining wall at 
St Kilda; and then at 

Hampton
 which is also a beach-side suburb of Melbourne but now forms part of 

Brighton
.  It was later found to be laid with bricks that had the names and date of execution.  A total of 14 marked bricks were found, one of which read  M.N 22.10.94 , referring to Martha Needle, who was convicted of poisoning her husband, 3 children and brother-in-law, and was hanged on 22 October 1894.
At St Kilda beach, this retaining wall is the one that swimmers lay their backs to from the grass. It borders the raised walkway and sand of the beach-front with bluestone.  


Housing for other guards were 17 smaller homes along 





Swanston Street




 as of 1860 and the Chief Warden s house was a palatial 2-story affair on the corner of Russell Street and facing Franklin Street built during the 1890s 


The gaol was the setting for 136 hangings, the most infamous being that of bushranger 

Ned Kelly
 in 1880. The jail was closed in 1929 when Police stables were constructed.  


By 1924 it was a run-down structure; then parts of the Gaol were demolished. For a short time it was used as a Military prison during World War II.  Later it was used as a storage facility for the Victoria Police Force whose headquarters were nearby in Russell Street.  In 1972, the Gaol was reopened in its current role as a public museum.




 Today 


The building is currently a museum drawing thousands of tourists annually. The Gaol is open every day except Good Friday and Christmas, 9:30 am   5:00 pm, and special candlelight night tours can also be arranged.


The Old Melbourne Gaol is Victoria's oldest surviving penal establishment. It currently exhibits 19th century gaol life, including the 
death masks and memorabilia of some of Melbourne's most notorious criminals, including the death mask of notorious 
bushranger 

Ned Kelly
. At the age of 25 years, he was convicted of killing a police officer after a two-day trial.  Edward  Ned  Kelly was executed 11 November 1880. A skull which is said to be Ned Kelly's was also on display for many years but thieves stole the skull in 1978 and it has never been recovered. It remains a mystery as to whether the skull actually was Kelly's in the first place.  His body was buried within the gaol grounds as were all the condemned convicts; none were afforded a plot in a cemetery.  


The tour guides delight in telling stories of ghosts, or photos being taken containing  
ectoplasm  and the cells are small and quite scary.  Parapsycologist (Ghost Hunters) have spent a night and recorded the voice of a woman, repeatedly screaming for help!. The Old Melbourne Gaol also has a court house where one woman,  Elizabeth Scott  was sentenced to being hanged - the first woman to ever be hanged at the Old Melbourne Gaol. Three more female executions would eventually follow.  This figure is far surpassed by the number of men executed at the Gaol - 164 in total.

Puerto Rican singers




Odilio Gonzalez was born in 1939 in the center of the island of 

Puerto Rico
, in the small town of 

Lares
. His charm, sweet voice and youthful good looks turned him into a popular child star after a series of early radio performances in the capital city of 

San Juan
.

One of Puerto Rico's most renown and beloved popular singers, Odilio Gonzalez has enjoyed an avid following for his expert singing of the island's ancient traditional poetic song form, the decima (also known as  jibaro  music), as well as a crooner of mainstream pop music. His stage name was  Jibarito de Lares . He debuted in 1955 at the age of 16 on the 

New York City
 stage, singing before throngs of enthusiastic and nostalgic Puerto Ricans in the famed Teatro Puerto Rico. His first recordings of traditional jibaro singing for the Ansonia label were also made in New York City during that period. He was considered a child prodigy in the music business during the Golden Age of New York jibaro music recordings of the 1950s. Fellow Lares native 
Jose Feliciano's singing style was heavily influenced by Gonzalez's during his early youth.


Odilio Gonzalez crossed over into pop music in 1962 when he records Celos Sin Motivo, composed by Ismael Santiago, which broadens his appeal to a far greater audience. His greatest hit, perhaps was  Yo Tenia Una Luz  (I had a light), recorded during the early 1970s, became a widely popular Christmas song and today is considered among the ranks of traditional songs, in the way  White Christmas  is considered  traditional  in the United States.


Odilio Gonzalez continues to perform around the Island and during numerous trips to the 








United States







 to sing before enthusiastic audiences of older Puerto Ricans expatriates.

Georgetown Day School is an independent, PreK-12 
school in 
Washington, DC.  It is familiarly called  GDS,  or less frequently  Georgetown Day ; the high school is sometimes abbreviated GDHS and the Lower and Middle schools are somethimes referd to as one as GDS-LMS or GDS-L/MS.  GDS was founded in 1945 as the first integrated school in the District.  Housed on two separate campuses in northwest Washington, the lower and middle schools (grades 
pre-kindergarten to eight) are located in the 
Palisades neighborhood, while the high school is located several miles away in 





Tenleytown




.   Both campuses feature libraries, full-size gymnasiums and athletic fields, black box theaters, fully equipped science labs, art studios, technology/multimedia labs, and student lounges and activity areas. Both facilities have elevators and are fully handicapped-accessible.


The school enrolls approximately 1000 students in any given year and graduates about 120 seniors each year.  GDS is known for a strong emphasis on the 
arts, especially the performing arts, continuing commitment to diversity, and its historical success in high school 
policy debate and 
quizbowl. (It was the #1 school in the nation at debate in 2006.)  Because it believes that students and teachers are partners in education, everyone at the school   students, faculty, and administrators   goes by first names. The current head of school is Peter M. Branch.

Anglicanism
Church of England ecclesiastical polity




The Parochial Church Council or PCC, is the executive body of a 

Church of England
 
parish. It is constituted as a body corporate by the Church Representation Rules set out in Schedule 3 to the Synodical Government Measure 1969, and consists of the clergy and churchwardens of the parish, together with a number of representatives of the laity elected by the annual parochial church meeting of the parish.  Its powers and duties are defined by certain 
Acts of Parliament and other legislation, principally the 
Parochial Church Councils (Powers) Measure 1956. It has the responsibility of co-operating with the 
incumbent (
rector, 
vicar or 
priest) or 
priest in charge in promoting the mission of the Church in its parish.

Formally, the PCC is responsible for the financial affairs of the Church and the care and maintenance of the church fabric and its contents. These latter responsibilities are executed by 
churchwardens.  It also has a voice in the forms of Service used by the church and may make representations to the 
bishop on matters affecting the welfare of the parish.


PCCs were set up in 1919 as a successor to the 
vestries,1 which had had their civil functions removed in 1894 with the establishment of 
civil parishes.

Larch Prover, or LP for short, is an interactive 
theorem proving system for multisorted 
first-order logic. It is currently used at 
MIT and elsewhere to reason about designs for 
circuits, concurrent 
algorithms, 
hardware, and 
software. Unlike most theorem provers, which attempt to find 
proofs automatically for correctly stated conjectures, LP is intended to assist users in finding and correcting flaws in conjectures   the predominant activity in the early stages of the design process.

LP works efficiently on large problems, has many important user amenities, and can be used by relatively naive users. It was developed and is being maintained by

Electrostatics
Physical quantities




In 
electromagnetism, electric flux is 
flux of the 
electric field. Electric flux is proportional to the electric 
field lines going through a virtual surface.  Electric flux over surface S is therefore given by:


\Phi_E = \int_S \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A}

where E is the electric field and dA is a differential area on the closed surface S with an outward facing 
surface normal defining its direction. 

For closed 
Gaussian surface, electric flux is given by:


\Phi_E = \oint_S \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = \frac{Q_S}{\epsilon_0}

where QS is the 
charge enclosed by the surface (including both 
free and 
bound charge), and  0 is the 
electric constant. This relation is known as 
Gauss' law for electric field in its 
integral form and it is one of four 
Maxwell's equations.

Ernst Johannes Wigforss (
January 24 
1881 
2 January 
1977) was a 







Swedish






 
linguist (dialectologist), mostly known as a prominent member of the 
Social Democratic Workers' Party and Swedish Minister of Finance. Wigforss became one of the main theoreticians in the development of the Swedish Social Democratic movement s 
revision of 
















Marxism















, from a revolutionary to a 
reformist organization. He was also inspired
and stood ideological close to the ideas of 
Fabian Society
and the 
Guild Socialism and inspired by people like , 













R. H. Tawney












, 
L.T. Hobhouse and 
J. A. Hobson.He made 
contributions in his early writings about 








Industrial democracy







 and 
Workers' self-management.     


Born in the town of 

Halmstad
 in 





Halland




 in south-western Sweden, Wigforss studied at 

Lund University
 from 1899 and completed a 
doctorate in 1913 with a dissertation on the dialect of south Halland, becoming 
docent in 
Scandinavian languages at the university the same year. He taught at the  
gymnasium in Lund (Lunds hogre allmanna laroverk) 1911-1914 and as lecturer of German and Swedish at the Latin gymnasium in 

Gothenburg
 from 1914.


Wigforss had published on political issues before completing his dissertation work and was in 1919 elected a social democratic member of the First Chamber of the Swedish Parliament, representing Gothenburg, where he became member of various committees. He was appointed member of the third cabinet of 

Hjalmar Branting
 in 1924,  after Branting's resignation in January 1925 that of 

Rickard Sandler
, and was made temporary Minister of Finance on 24 January, 1925 when 
Fredrik Thorsson fell ill, succeeding Thorsson on 8 May of the same year, following his death. The Sandler cabinet resigned on 
June 7, 
1926. 


He was again Minister of Finance in the cabinet of 

Per Albin Hansson
 1932 1936 and in the cabinet of Hansson and (from the former's death in 1946) 

Tage Erlander
 1936 1949.


Some say that Wigforss' economic policies were strongly influenced by


John Maynard Keynes
, but it's more likely to argue that he anticipated Keynes, as he proposed counter-cyclical economic policy before becoming minister of finance from 1932 until 1949. But it is perhaps more accurate to claim that his main economic influences came from 









Knut Wicksell








 and he inspired the younger people like 

Gunnar Myrdal
 and the 
Stockholm school ,that worked in the same direction as Keynes at the same time. 

John Kenneth Galbraith
 writes in his book , 1991, that it would be more fair to say  The Swedish Economic Revolution  than the  Keyneisan revolution  in economics, and that Wigforss was first in this transformation of the economical thinking and practice. 


In his pamphlet Har vi rad att arbeta? (can we afford working?), widely believed to have won the 1932 elections for the Social Democrats, he made fun of the Liberal theory that cuts is the proper remedy of economic downturns. Although he is considered as the creator of the Swedish high-tax economy, controversies with Minister for Social Affairs 
Gustav Moller (who would have preferred taxing to have been even higher) prevented both from being elected party chairman and Prime Minister at the death of Hansson.


After his resignation, Wigforss continued until his death to write and speak of political issues and was considered as one of the most innovative and daring Social Democrat politicians. For example he supported the 
anti-nuclear movement of the fifties and contributed to the discontinuation of the Swedish nuclear arms programme in 1962.

Calcot Park House




Calcot, or Calcot Row, is a 
suburb west of 

Reading
 in the 

English
 county of 

Berkshire
. Calcot is situated along the 





A4 Bath Road




 between the old hamlet of 

Horncastle
 and Junction 12 of the 





M4 motorway




. The suburb of 

Tilehurst
 lies to the north and in the hills above Calcot, while the village of 

Theale
 lies to the west across the motorway. The recent housing estates of 
Beansheaf Farm and 








Fords Farm







 lie to the south, and may be considered part of Calcot.1


Although unquestionably a suburb of Reading, Calcot is not within the Borough of Reading. Rather it is split between the 
civil parishes of 

Holybrook
 and 

Tilehurst
, with that part of Calcot north of the Bath Road in Tilehurst parish and that part south in Holybrook parish. The whole of Holybrook parish, together with that part of Calcot within Tilehurst parish, form the Calcot 
electoral ward of the 
unitary authority of 



West Berkshire


.
Both parishes have elected parish councils, and together with the unitary authority are responsible for different aspects of local government. Calcot is part of the 
Reading West parliamentary constituency.12


The Calcot ward of West Berkshire has an area of 324 hectares and a total population of 9,093 living in 3,554 dwellings.3


There are two schools in Calcot sharing the same grounds, Calcot Junior School and Calcot Infant School which incorporates a nursery. When children leave primary school at 11 they attend secondary schools in neighbouring villages.



Calcot Park is a large 
country house and 





estate




, to the north east of Calcot. Over the years the estate has been the home to 


Sir Peter Vanlore

, 
Frances Kendrick, and to 
John Blagrave (a relative of the famous mathematician 

John Blagrave
 who built the present house in 1759). Today the house has been converted into 
apartments and grounds have become a 
golf course.4






Calcot Mill


 is a former 
watermill situated on the 



Holy Brook


 to the south of Calcot. On the site of a mill originally owned by 









Reading Abbey








, the current mill has been converted into apartments.

Hospitals in Uganda




The largest state-owned hospital in 

Uganda
 is 





Mulago Hospital




, built in 

Kampala
 1962, with around 1500 beds. Once it had an excellent 
medical school, with visitors from around the world to learn about 
tropical diseases. During the 

Amin
 administration, the hospital deteriorated along with the rest of the country's infrastructure. Now it still serves an important role, but is very badly maintained. 

There are many 





NGO




s operating charitable hospitals now around the country, especially in rural areas, where the national health budget is rarely to be found. 



Dr. Ian Clarke, a missionary from 

Northern Ireland
, came out in 1986 along with his family, and built 





Kiwoko Hospital




 in 
Luwero, now a 200 bed charitable hospital. His book, The man with the key is gone, is an account of this time.  He has now become a resident of Uganda and is now opening his own 200 bed private hospital, International Hospital Kampala, which is the first 
ISO certified hospital in the country.


Health provision in Uganda is shared between Government-funded facilities (typically large hospitals), private not-for-profit facilities which include church-supported hospitals, medium-sized clinics, private for-profit or commercial health units and self-employed physicians.    The share is 30% Government (Ministry of Health), 45% not-for-profit (NGOs) and 25% for-profit (Private). The distribution of services  tends to mean rural areas are underserved and lower income households in urban areas are also underserved as for-profit outlets and crowded government hospitals are concentrated in the towns.  IHK has responded to this imbalance by encouraging companies in Kampala to sponsor a ward of beds to enable subsidised care of serious cases among lower income households.


A separate, independent philanthropic not for profit NGO, 





Hope Clinic Lukuli




, has been working for six years to minimise the financial barriers to health information and treatment among the Kampala population in Makindye Division.  As a General Practice facility it assists in maternal care, malaria management and childhood diseases as well as providing HIV counselling, testing, care and support services.

: Mature (M)





Blue Stinger is an 





survival horror game




 released in 1999 for the 

Dreamcast
 
game console. It's notable for having been released in 



North America


 nine days before the Dreamcast, which was required for playing the game. It was localized in North America by Activision, which took away the cinematic style cameras, and used a fixed, behind-the-player third-person view like 





Tomb Raider




. This revamped camera style was met with both critical acclaim and criticism. Some argued that the change took away from the dramatic tension for which the 
Japanese version had become famous. However, others celebrated the new camera style as a feature that gave the game an edge over survival horror games such as 
Resident Evil, that utilized fixed angles.



Story


65 million years ago, a 
meteorite crashes into the 
Yucatan Peninsula, subsequently wiping out the 
dinosaurs and paving the way for 
humans. Now, in 2000, an island emerges where the meteorite is thought to have landed, and is granted the name  Dinosaur Island.  A 
biotech corporation then takes up shop on the island. In 2018, Eliot Ballade, an elite member of the ESER forces, is vacationing near Dinosaur Island when something falls from the sky and leaves the island sealed under a mysterious dome of energy. When a mysterious, ethereal being called Nephilim shows up to chase Ballade, he takes it upon himself to solve the enigma of Dinosaur Island.

Characters





Eliot G. Ballade: The game's protagonist, an ESER member on vacation with his friend Tim. He quickly gets wrapped up in the events around Dinosaur Island once his ship (and Tim) get trapped in the energy dome around the island. Voiced by 

Ryan Drummond
.







Dogs Bower: Eliot's teammate, Captain of an HMS Sienna. A long time resident of Dinosaur Island who has his share of friends and rivals there. Dogs' design is based (loosely) on Resident Evil's Barry Burton. Voiced by 

Deem Bristow








Janine King: A member of KISS, Kimra's security team; both a genius in computers and shooting. Some things remain a mystery about her, but strangely enough, she seems to know a lot about Dogs. Voiced by 

Lani Minella
.







'









Nephilim








': An alien creature that often observes Eliot and Dogs' progress. Although taking the shape of a fictional goddess from a fictional series, Nephilm has no distinct original shape.






Gameplay


Blue Stinger does offer some unique aspects. For one, the environments are entirely 




3D



, something that at the time was a rarity for games of its ilk. For another, with the US release, the camera was changed to something more analogous to Tomb Raider.
http://localhost:18088/wiki/index.php/Blue_Stinger#endnote_Bartholowstingerreview2


Players healed themselves in real-time using food and drinks bought from vending machines, forcing players to heal only when it was safe. Combat consisted of purchasing weapons and ammunition in the same manner and the technology of each weapon was very high; players could afford swords, rocket launchers, Napalm launchers and triple-barrelled shotguns. Players could access melee or fire arms in the player's inventory with the press of a trigger and each weapon was exclusive to the character they played as: Eliot started out with a pistol while Dogs started out with a crossbow.


Blue Stinger differs very much from the survival horror game genre. For example, there are absolutely no attempt at atmospherics in the game: the soundtrack is a triumphant and often overly-climactic action score that accompanies every area and the enemies, despite being gruesome and partly amputatable, sprinkle the player with gold coins once killed.

In the 19th century, Porthcurno was connected to the rest of the World by telegraph cables.




Porthcurno is a small village in the parish of 





St. Levan




 (N 50:02:47, W 5:39:21) located in a valley on the south coast of 

Cornwall
, 

England
, 
UK.  It is approximately 9 miles (14 km) to the west of the market town of 

Penzance
 and about 3 miles (5 km) from 








Land's End







, the most westerly point of the English mainland. Access by road is from the north end of the valley only along a narrow 



'unclassified'


 spur road off the B3283 



'B' class road


. The road ends at St. Levan 



church


 about half a mile further on from the village. There is a public car park at the southern end of the valley for about 200 cars where parking is free out of season. The village is also accessible on foot by the 





South West Coast Path




, being about two hours walk from Land's End or four hours walk from Penzance for fit cliff walkers. There is an occasional but reliable bus service linking Porthcurno with Penzance, Lands End and nearby villages and hamlets including

Porth Kernow


The name Porthcurno evolved from the earlier spelling 'Porth Kernow' or 'Porth Curnow'. In the 

Cornish language
 'Porth-Curnow' meant 'Port (or Bay) of Cornwall'. Today there is no evidence of early commercial port activity but some remains of man-made tracks for horse-drawn vehicles are visible on one of the footpaths from the beach passing up on the east side of the valley.




The Cable Station and Engineering College





Porthcurno Valley looking north showing the car park and a few of the former Engineering College buildings.



In the late nineteenth century, the remote beach at Porthcurno became internationally famous as the 
British termination of early submarine 
telegraph cables, the first of which was landed in 1870, part of an early international link stretching all the way to 

India
, which was then a 
British colony. In 1872, the Eastern Telegraph Company (ETC) Limited was formed which took over the operation of the cables and built a cable office in the lower valley. The 
concrete cable hut, where the cable shore ends were connected to their respective 
landlines, is a preserved building and still stands today at the top of the beach. ETC and its cable operations expanded through the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, in 1928 to merge with 
Marconi's Wireless Telegraph Company Limited to form Imperial and International Communications Limited which was re-named 
Cable and Wireless Limited in 1934.


In the Inter-War years, the Porthcurno cable office operated as many as 14 cables, for a time becoming the largest submarine cable telegraph station in the World. Porthcurno is still known colloquially by the 
acronym 'PK' being represented in 










Morse code









 as 'di-dah-dah-dit' followed by 'dah-di-dah'. In the early days of expensive telegraphy, this could be easily sent economically and unambiguously with just two letters instead of ten for the full word.


Over the years, many apprentices were trained at the Porthcurno cable office in 
telegraphy and supporting skills. In 1950 Cable and Wireless opened an engineering college offering courses in branches of 
telecommunications on the site for employees, secondees and external students. Porthcurno is still recalled today by senior staff at telecommunications offices across the World who were former students here. The cable office closed in 1970, exactly 100 years after the first cable was landed, but the college remained open, receiving substantial investment in buildings and training equipment through the 1970s and 1980s, eventually closing permanently in 1993. The closure was a very sad event locally, but it was perhaps inevitable given the costs to Cable and Wireless of maintaining such a geographically remote site. The subsequent demolition of some of the less attractive 70s college buildings, in particular the prison-like block of no architectural merit known as 'Howitt House' received popular support. Shortly after the closure the Cable and Wireless 






Porthcurno Telegraph Museum





 was opened. This award winning museum, has been widely recommended to tourists, local people and schools in the area, and has also been featured on the 

BBC
 TV documentary series 

What the Victorians Did for Us
, presented by the scientist and broadcaster Dr. 

Adam Hart-Davis
. It occupies some of the former college buildings and includes several exhibits which are located in 'The 
Tunnel'.


Porthcurno was a critical communications target and vulnerable to attack during the Second World War so a tunnel was bored into the granite valley side by local tin mining engineers in 1940 to accommodate the essential telegraph equipment. The main entrance was protected by double bomb-proof, 
gas-proof doors and a covert escape route for staff via a secondary tunnel was incorporated from the back leading to the fields above. The interior was that of a windowless open-plan office constructed as a building shell within the granite void, complete with sloping roof, false ceiling, plastered and decorated walls and drainage for water seepage. The Tunnel environment being secure, dry, and at a virtually constant temperature proved to be ideal for the sensitive telegraph equipment and it continued to house the subsequently upgraded equipment until the cable office closure. It was then used for training facilities for the Engineering College until its subsequent closure when it was handed over to the museum.


In recent years, six very high capacity modern descendants of submarine telegraph cables, using 
fibre optic technology have been landed at Porthcurno forming a significant part of the UK connection to the international telecommunications 'backbone'. Each of these has literally thousands of times the capacity of all of their predecessors put together. However today they use Porthcurno merely as a landing point for connecting to the UK telecommunications infrastructure, passing directly via landlines to a terminating station at 





Skewjack




 about 2 miles (3 km) inland from Porthcurno.




Porthcurno Coastal Area





Porthcurno Bay and Logan Rock headland



The cliffs and coastline around Porthcurno are officially designated 
areas of outstanding natural beauty and widely considered as some of the most visually stunning in the South West. These can be enjoyed by walkers using the many public footpaths in the area. The South West coastal footpath passes through the area often within just a few yards of the clifftops. Extensive coastal areas are now owned and maintained by the 

National Trust
 and the remainder by the local 
parish council on behalf of 









Cornwall County Council








. The nearby cliffs rise to 60 to 70 m and are formed from a bedrock of 
prismatic 
granite; over the 
geological timescale having been eroded, shaped and divided vertically and horizontally sometimes almost into rounded cubic blocks, for example the nearby Logan Rock.


An ancient bridleway, probably the original route to Porthcurno beach via the nearby Trendrennen Farm to the east has recently been opened by the 
Ramblers Association. In early 2006 this was passable on foot after a dry period but requires further restoration work and drainage. This was probably an early route to Porthcurno beach before the present road was built, used by horses and carts to collect seaweed which was used for land fertilisation.


Porthcurno beach, a few hundred yards south of the village is situated in the shelter of the 
Logan Rock headland just less than one mile (1 km) to the east. The beach is noted for its coarse sand of broken sea shells, steep shelf and strong 
rip-currents. Sometimes combinations of wind, tides and sea currents can change the 'sandscape' dramatically in a few hours, but it is unusual for the beach to be completely inundated at high tide. To the immediate east of Porthcurno beach is a small tidal beach called Green Bay. Sometimes this is accessible with caution from Porthcurno beach briefly at low tide. 



Pedn Vounder beach at low tide with the Logan Rock headland behind


Another tidal beach called 


Pedn Vounder

 lies further to the east between Porthcurno and the Logan Rock headland for which footpath access is by a steep and rugged path leading down from the cliff path. Often a sand-bank forms off Pedn Vounder at low tide. Unlike the nearby fishing coves of 





Penberth




 and 


Porthgwarra

, about one and a half miles (2 km) to the east and west respectively, Porthcurno has no known recent history of commercial 
fishing activity.





The white pyramid which replaced a clifftop hut at which the submarine telegraph cable from Brest in France was terminated 



About half way along the main coastal footpath from Porthcurno to Logan Rock another path loops off to the cliffs above Pedn Vounder beach. Beside this is a white pyramid built from granite blocks about 3 m (10 feet) tall. Originally at this point stood a hut which housed the termination of a 
submarine telegraph cable to the French port of 









Brest








 which was laid in 1880. Some of the stone 
ducting built up on the cliffside is still visible from the footpath nearby. This was the first (indirect) cable connection from the UK to the 





American




 continent passing from Porthcurno to Brest and then via the trans-Atlantic cable first to 
Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, off the coast of Canada, and then a further 500 km (313 miles) to 





Cape Cod




, 

Massachusetts
. In 1919 the cable end was moved to the Eastern Telegraph Company's hut a few hundred yards to the west at the top of Porthcurno Beach, where it remained in operation until 1962. The conspicuous pyramid replaced the hut because the former had previously been used by local fishermen as a land reference.




Logan Rock





Main article: 
Logan Rock


The 
Logan Rock headland, about 30 minutes' walk from Porthcurno to the east along the coastal footpath on the east side of Porthcurno Bay is famous for the 80 
tonne 
granite rocking stone (Logan Rock) perched at the top of the middle outcrop of rocks on the small rocky 
peninsula. Millennia of 
erosion had balanced it so finely that one person could move it easily and visibly. In 1824 a group of sailors led by 
Lieutenant Goldsmith, nephew of the 
poet 

Oliver Goldsmith
, and the worse for drink climbed up to Logan Rock armed with 
crowbars and dislodged it, allowing it to fall down the cliff. Such was the disgust of the local people at this blatant act of 
vandalism, that they complained to the 
Admiralty and Goldsmith was ordered to replace the rock at his own expense. It took 7 months, 60 labourers and cost Goldsmith  130 at 1824 prices to replace it. It is said that Logan Rock has never really rocked properly since that time. The original 
invoice for equipment and labour is now displayed on the wall of The Logan Rock public house in the nearby village of 





Treen, Cornwall




.


Just to the north of the peninsula is evidence of an 
Iron Age cliff fort called Treryn Dinas, comprising about 5 
ramparts, ditches and some evidence of round dwelling huts. There is a small rocky island off the Logan Rock peninsula called Horrace and another smaller granite island which is only visible at low tide, providing a useful quick indication of the tide state.




Climate and Tourism


The natural beauty of the area and its mild climate make the beach and surrounding coastline very popular with tourists throughout the year but especially in the summer months, and they can become very crowded during the school holidays in July and August. The prevailing wind is from the south west and the winters are unusually mild for its latitude because of the influence of the warm 
Gulf Stream sea current crossing the 
Atlantic Ocean from warmer seas around the 


Gulf of Mexico

. The local area has some of the highest average annual air temperatures of the United Kingdom. In common with much of the south Cornish coast, summer daily maxima rarely exceed about 28 degrees 


Celsius

 and sub-zero temperatures and frost are uncommon in the winter. Occasional snowfalls, when they do occur, usually melt into 
slush within a few hours. The lower valley and beach enjoy a 
micro-climate being sheltered in most directions from the prevailing and other winds. For the more exposed cliff-top areas, 
gale-force winds are common throughout the year which occasionally cause moderate structural damage to buildings locally.


In the summer months Porthcurno is popular with families on holiday with young children who enjoy playing on the beach and perhaps some supervised bathing. In the quieter seasons visitors tend to be local people and day-trippers from other parts of Cornwall. Many tourists come from elsewhere in the United Kingdom and Europe and may have rented self-catering or bed and breakfast accommodation nearby. There is a small 
sub post office and general stores, open all year, at the north end of the valley and a small cafe and ice cream stand near the car park which are open during the peak season.




History


Development of the area was dominated for over one hundred years by the operations of the cable station owned by 
Cable and Wireless plc and its predecessor companies. Probably over 90% of the inhabitants were either employees of Cable and Wireless or were directly supported by it.


During the 
Second World War, Porthcurno was designated a Vulnerable Point and was heavily defended and fortified as a part of 











British anti-invasion preparations










. Defences included 





pillboxes




, a petroleum warfare beach flame barrage.1


The development of motor transport in the twentieth century and improved prosperity after the Second World War provided many with cars and made Porthcurno less than half an hour's drive from Penzance so many traveled daily from Penzance and other parts of Cornwall.


Much of the beach and surrounding shores previously owned by Cable and Wireless was donated to the 

National Trust
 in 1993 in common with many other parts of the Cornish coastline.


Most of the houses along the 'Valley' road were owned by the former Cable and Wireless Engineering College and sold off subsequent to its closure in 1993. Many of them have recently been converted to holiday 
flats making the population very seasonally dependent. Today the predominant industry of the area is tourism which is still quite seasonal despite recent improvements in communications and attempts to attract tourists out of season.




The Minack Theatre


Just out of sight of Porthcurno beach in the cliff face to the west is the 




Minack Theatre



, an open air theatre with a unique stage backdrop of Porthcurno Bay and the Logan Rock headland. It is an unusual setting for plays staged during the summer months ranging from the traditional 
Shakespeare to the more contemporary. The Theatre is accessible on foot from the coastal footpath by a rugged path in the cliff face or more easily by road taking the steep narrow hill leaving Porthcurno to the south towards 
St. Levan Church and turning left at the summit. The Minack Theatre was built virtually single handedly by the late 
Rowena Cade who worked there into her eighties with the support of local labourers. Today the Rowena Cade exhibition centre, coffee shop and theatre are open to visitors for most of the year but the theatre largely undergoes maintenance during the winter months in preparation for the following season.




Wireless Point





The original pivoted cage which supported a 170 feet (59 m) mast and antenna erected by the Eastern Telegraph Company in 1902 at Pedn-men-an-Mere near Porthcurno to monitor wireless transmissions by Marconi from Poldhu, across Mount's Bay



A small headland to the west of the Minack Theatre called Pedn-men-an-Mere (Cornish: 'rocky headland by  the sea') is known locally as 'Wireless Point'. This retains the rusted but still visible remains of the base and tether points of a 
wireless telegraphy 
antenna mast that was erected in 1902 by the Eastern Telegraph Company. It was thought that this was used to 'spy' on the early wireless transmissions by 
Marconi, a 
developer of radio, from the 








Poldhu







 cliff top about 17 miles (27 km) to the east, across 




Mount's Bay



 on the west side of the 
Lizard Peninsula. In those days Marconi's 'wireless telegraphy' was seen as a potential threat to the established 'cable and line telegraphy' on which Porthcurno and many local jobs depended.  Much to their regret, the company mistakenly concluded that Marconi's efforts posed no threat to their cable business.  However, Marconi's secretive development of the 
Shortwave Beam Wireless System at Poldhu would be so successful that Eastern and many other cable telegraph companies were forced into near-bankruptcy by 1928.


There is a pair of large boulders near the cliff edge of which the smaller one, weighing about 5 tonnes, can be rocked by the weight of one adult.




Porth Chapel Beach





Porth Chapel Beach from Pedn-men-an-Mere





Pedn-men-an-Mere overlooks the small secluded tidal beach of Porth Chapel to the west. Porth Chapel beach is named after the remains of a medieval chapel visible next to the footpath about 30 m above the beach. There is a spring known as the St. Levan Holy Well further up the cliffside which may be reached by ancient granite steps. The steps were covered for many years but were discovered in 1931 by the Reverend H. T. Valantine and Dr. Vernon Favel. They were restored in 2003, part of a Cornwall County Council restoration project and were opened by 
The Countess of Wessex.





Parish church of St Levan



The parish church of 





St Levan




 lies a few hundred yards up the valley to the north. There is a small car park in a field next to St Levan Church.

 Kir'Shara  is the name of the 85th episode from the television series .  Kir'shara  first aired on 
December 3, 
2004, on the 








American







 television network 

UPN
.


This episode is entitled Kir'Shara for the mythical 





artifact




 that was claimed to contain the only surviving writings of the revered 


Surak

, father of 
Vulcan logic. This episode also features 
The Battle of Andoria.



Plot summary




Note: This episode is part of a three episode arc involving 


Captain Archer's

 clandestine journey through planet Vulcan. To follow the full plot, see the other two episodes of the arc,  
The Forge  and  
Awakening .


As the 







Enterprise






 under the temporary command of 
Commander Tucker is diverted to 
Andoria, the 


Vulcan High Command

 begins planning for a large scale pre-emptive strike against Andoria based on the falsified report that the 
Andorian Imperial Command is planning to adapt their vessels with a powerful 





Xindi




 weaponry. Furthermore, the Vulcan High Command, under the leadership of the villainous Administrator 
V'Las, is working under the assumption that the Andorians will  sooner or later  make use of their new weapon, and wonder  Is it logical for us to wait to that day? 


Back at the forge, Captain Archer, his science officer 














T'Pol













, and the leader of the 
Syrranites 
T'Pau, have found the sacred Kir'Shara and begin on their journey to take the ancient relic back to the Vulcan capital. We learn from T'Pau that the discovery of the Kir'Shara would have an enormous impact on the High Command and all of Vulcan.


Meanwhile, onboard the Enterprise, 












Lieutenant Reed











 raises the concerns of some of his fellow crewmates whether Commander Trip's plan to disobey Admiral Gardner's direct orders,  and warn the Andorians of the impending Vulcan pre-emptive strike is in the best interests of 



Starfleet


.


Enterprise's long time friend in the Andorian military, Commander 


Shran

, has been hiding his military task force inside a nebula. Upon contact with Enterprise and its temporary occupant, Ambassador 


Soval

, Shran learns that the Vulcan High Command has been assembling a massive fleet near Regulus, beyond the range of Andorian listening stations. However, Shran does not fully trust the words of a Vulcan, even if it is from the highly respected Ambassador Soval. Therefore, to be certain that the mobilization of the massive Andorian Imperial fleet is not in vain, Shran abducts Ambassador Soval, secretly teleporting him from the Enterprise.
A device that lowers Vulcan emotional threshold is then used on the Ambassador as Shran repeatedly asks the actual location of the Vulcan invasion fleet.


Upon the discovery that their guest, Ambassador Soval, has been abducted by the Andorian fleet, Enterprise pursues Shran's lead ship into the nebula and begins firing. Upon this act, Shran orders his ships out of the nebula and agrees to return the Ambassador to Enterprise. Shran does not fire back at the human ship, afraid to  make enemies of the humans. 


Still at the forge, T'Pol and T'Pau engage in a heated discussion over the logic of following the leadership of Captain Archer    a man who claims to be in possession of Surak's 
katra. During the exchange, T'Pol becomes emotional, and quickly apologizes, saying  My mother's death has affected me more than I realized.  She also discloses that during a forced mind-meld several years ago, she was infected with Pa'nar syndrome. T'Pau explains that Pa'nar syndrome is caused by melders who have been improperly trained and, further, that one with great experience can correct the neurological imbalance    a fact the Vulcan High Command has kept secret, preferring to refer to the condition as an incurable, stigmatizing disease. T'Pau performs a mind-meld on her and a subsequent episode confirmed that T'Pol's Pa'nar syndrome was cured as a result.


As Archer's journey to the Vulcan capital is progressing, a team of commandos with direct orders from the High Command to take the Kir'Shara from the Syrranites, tracks down Archer and his team. In the brawl that follows, T'Pol is injured and is taken prisoner by the commandos while Archer and T'Pau narrowly escape. Upon interrogation, T'Pol claims that the Kir'Shara is being taken to Mount Seleya, thus diverting the commandos from Archer's true destination -- the Vulcan capital. T'Pol further declares to her captors that  I am a Syrranite. We don't lie . Whether this is, in fact, a lie is a matter of debate, as there are signs that T'Pol may have, indeed, become a Syrranite following her meld with T'Pau.


Captain Archer and T'Pau, in a daring plan to free T'Pol, lure the commandos to Gallicite deposits where their metallic weapons act as lightning rods and incapacitate the commandos. Archer then learns that, unfortunately, his first officer is not with the commandos, instead, she is being taken to the Vulcan High Command.


Back at the Enterprise, Ambassador Soval has been returned, and remains at the 










Sick bay









 where his former captor, Shran, pays him a visit to check on his condition. To the pleasure of Shran, the Ambassador is expected to recover.


Meanwhile, Enterprise and six other alien ships have taken position near the Andorian system, directly in the path of the Vulcan strike fleet. They have learned that twelve Vulcan cruisers are approaching, and unfortunately, allied ships are too far out of range, and they will be on their own for the subsequent confrontation with the Vulcan fleet.


Once the Vulcan fleet meets the Andorians, Commander Tucker orders the Enterprise directly between both fleets, saying,  If the Vulcans want to start a war, they're going to have to get through us first.  The Vulcans begin their attack nonetheless. Although at the first, the Vulcan fleet only targets the Andorians, they are ordered by the High Command to destroy Enterprise after Enterprise opens fire on one of the 



Vulcan ship


s to protect a damaged Andorian ship.


Archer and T'Pau reach the Vulcan capital and T'Pol's husband, Koss, helps the duo transport into the Vulcan High Command by providing them with the required access codes. Thereupon, they present the Kir'Shara to the High Council and reveal that the bombing of Earth's embassy was an excuse by the High Command Administrator to round up the Syrranites. Minister Kuvak, a member of the High council, quickly takes control of a hand weapon and fires on Administrator V'Las, who is attempting to destroy the Kir'Shara. Kuvak also immediately orders the Vulcan fleet commander to cease the attack on the Andorians and withdraw.


Koss comes aboard the Enterprise to inform T'Pol that he is releasing her from their marriage, saying  I know you only bonded with me to help your mother.  Soon afterwards, the katra that had been hosted by Captain Archer is transferred to a Vulcan priest (coincidentally the same priest who conducted Koss and T'Pol's marriage ceremony).


The far reaching consequences of these events include the fact that Administrator V'Las has been relieved of his position and the conflict between Vulcan and Andoria appears to have been averted. Even more substantial, the Vulcan High Command is dissolved. This means that the Vulcans would no longer be watching over Starfleet's every move, as T'Pau explains,  It's time for Earth to stand on its own. 


The end, however, does not come until former Administrator V'Las meets with Talok, the officer in charge of his former commando team    and we find that Talok is actually a 









Romulan








. V'Las asks to be allowed to leave Vulcan with Talok (who is returning to Romulus), but Talok refuses, claiming that V'Las' disappearance would draw suspicion.  V'Las asks Talok what will happen now that their operation has failed; Talok replies,  The reunification of our people is only a matter of time.  Star Trek: Enterprise was cancelled before this plotline could be continued, although the theme of Romulan-Vulcan reunification would emerge in the time of .




Trivia






 Originally, T'Pol was to be the character T'Pau. The prospect of royalty payments to the estate of 















Theodore Sturgeon














 (the writer of 

Amok Time
) lead to the name being changed to T'Pol. 


The Romulan that appears briefly at the end of this episode is physically different from those seen in the  episode  

Balance of Terror
 .  He has cranial ridges much like the 
retcon Romulans' appearance when they appeared in later Trek series    a similar continuity fudge to that concerning the 
Klingons' differing appearances over the different timelines of the various movies and television shows.  The difference in the Klingon's appearances was the basis of a multi-part story in Enterprise's fourth    and final    season, but the explanation for the disparity in Romulan appearances was never addressed    possibly because of the show's cancellation before it could reach the planned Earth/Romulan war arc.

Ivan Massow (born 1967) is an entrepreneur and 











British










 Businessman, once chairman of 

London
's 

Institute of Contemporary Arts
 and now a Film Director, Producer and Writer. In 2007, following a disastrous litigation with insurance giant Zurich over a fallout regarding the collapse of his gay insurance company, he allegedly lost his fortune, attempted suicide, and went completely under the radar and out of public life. He currently lives in Barcelona.


 Personal life 


Born Ivan Field, Ivan Massow was adopted by a bachelor called John Massow. After a difficult upbringing and coming out as a homosexual his natural father asked him to change his name. His long-term boyfriend, James Knight, committed suicide on the only night they'd been apart since meeting. James was on medication for depression. The inquest found that the 'ecstasy punch' he'd been given that evening at an ex-partner s birthday party had reacted badly with his proscribed Prozac medication.  He jumped from a third floor window of a friend s house at 3.15am, and was pronounced dead on arrival to the hospital. Massow subsequently went on to chair the Mental Health and Social Inclusion Inquiry for 




MIND



, the mental health charity. 


In 1999 the press ran stories that Massow wanted to have a baby with gay comedienne, 







Jackie Clune






, but this never happened. Massow explained that it would have been  unfair on the child . Massow has fostered three children, and is seen as an urban dandy (with celebrity friends).  His flatmates were for a time were Conservative columnist, now Tory front-bencher, 

















Michael Gove
















 and head of 

Tory
 policy and Conservative London Mayoral candidate 









Nicholas Boles








 MP, a situation Massow described as  Tory 
Friends .


Massow's status in the gay community was severely damaged by his public support for 
Fox Hunting   he has been field Hunt Master and Joint Master of the Cokeham Bloodhounds. He has also owned race horses. He was a founder member of the  No Euro  campaign, but has since publicised his support for the Euro (most recently as guest political editor New Statesman, May 2007).




 Business 


Massow is severely 
dyslexic and left education with an 
O-level in metalwork in 

Brighton
 and a 



BTEC


 in art and design in 

Eastbourne
.  He started work in the insurance industry in 

Bristol
, where he worked for Friends Provident.  Within a few years, he had become very successful. As a 'closeted' homosexual working within the financial services industry, he experienced first-hand the homophobia that epitomised the early 1990s mortgage and life assurance industry, and decided to do something about it. Massow was angry that gay men were penalised for their sexuality when they applied for financial services: in a time of increasing 
HIV rates, gay men were seen as high risk and required to pay much higher premiums than other customers, whatever their circumstances. These premium increases averaged 400%, but could be as high as 600%. In addition, gay men would be required to give full details of, not just their relationships, but their sexual practices. They would then have to undergo a full medical examination and an HIV test and despite this, successful applicants (and many were refused cover by insurers automatically), would still find themselves listed on the ABIs  impaired life register  (a black-list shared by insurers). Finally, the fact that they d been made to go for an HIV test would prejudice all future applications. Worse still, there were no effective drugs for combating HIV at the time. This meant that such a diagnosis was a  death sentence  which many didn t want to receive from an insurance company, if at all. 


In 1990, Massow started a financial services business from a squat in 

Kentish Town
, 
north London, because he couldn't find funding for his idea. Having worked in the industry, he was able to source ways for gay people to take up mortgages and insurance at equal rates; rather than suffer the standard rejection, or massive increases in premiums that were levied by every insurer. Massow did this by researching how the various insurance computer  automatic underwriting systems  operated. He then smuggled clients through the maze. If a homosexual fell outside of these computerised anomalies and were underwritten by an employee of the company, rejection was the most likely outcome (and with that the loss of any hope of buying a home) or huge premiums levied, usually making a mortgage unaffordable; especially when you factor in interest rates at almost 16%. It must be remembered that life cover was a mandatory requirement for people applying for a mortgages (for most companies) until as late at 1997. The first company to relax the requirement for life assurance was a division of the Cheltenham and Gloucester building society in 1994.


Critics say that he was just cashing in on the  
pink pound  to become a millionaire. Others say he created the idea of the pink pound. Regardless, Massow is still remembered by the gay community as someone who successfully confronted the major companies to offer solutions at a time when no one else dared to be associated with this community.  His firm became the 10th largest IFA in the UK by 1997, valued by Catalyst Fund Managent Ltd at  22m, a VC company which owned a 26% share in the business.  


Massow also had a high profile failure. Among many ventures, he was an investor in the magazine Phaze in March 1994, but the venture collapsed and was, as Massow himself joked,  just a phase . 


In 1996, 
venture capitalists Catalyst invested in Massow Financial Services. By doing so, Massow secured his company's reputation as the premier supplier of financial services to gay men and women. In 1999, the firm entered into a reverse-takeover with company Rainbow Finance (its main competitor), as Massow sought to reduce his day-to-day involvement.  Rainbow Massow later collapsed, and in 2001. Massow returned to the business to rescue the business, returning it to profitability, which he later sold to his employees for just  100; fulfilling his ambition to reduce his involvement, and by way of thanks to staff who had withstood the roller coaster ride of an unsuccessful merger followed by a later disastrous partnership with Zurich Life, still being argued about in the High court at Bristol.     


In addition to many media appearances (having been the entrepreneurial 'expert' in  magazines such as FHM and Esquire through to TV shows such as the Big Breakfast and Richard and Judy), in autumn 2005 Ivan Massow entered into a one year challenge  on the 

Channel 4
 television series Make Me A Million; acting as investor and adviser to a start-up business, Halos n Horns; a children's shampoo. His competitors were  Emma Harrison and Chris Gorman. Massow won the challenge as his business was selected by the judges, Luke Jonson and Stelios Haji-Ioannou, as the most valuable and with the highest prospects for growth. The judges were impressed by the fact that Halos and Horns had already become the UK's second largest children s shampoo manufacturer, even before the programme had been aired. 


Although the idea had been given to Massow by his hairdresser, Joe Mills (who was rewarded with shares), the company and its success are credited to Leila Wilcox the MD, around whom the concept and branding Massow had modelled. She remains the active party and face of the brand. Since the sale of the business to Ceuta, Wilcox and Massow remain friends and are developing new business concepts.




Politics


Massow had joined the 

Conservative Party
 as a teenager and was Chairman of his local 




Young Conservatives



 at 14. He became friends with prominent Conservative politicians and was feted as a rare gay Tory. His money and good looks increased his visibility and association with top politicians. In 1999, Massow was 


Lady Thatcher

's escort at the Conservative Party Conference. In an interview with Attitude Magazine in June 2007, Massow revealed the fact that he had allowed his involvement with the Tory party to be blown out proportion to attract public attention. His re-involvement, after tepid involvement as a teenager, was part of a personal plan hatched by him and his flatmate, 









Nicholas Boles








, to use their whit and his profile to convince the party to modify and remove issues such as prejudice, in whatever form, as an election stance. Their other flatmate, 

















Michael Gove
















, also supported the repeal of section 28. Blair had taken the centre ground from the Tories.  


Massow had been active on gay issues. The Conservatives had seemed a strange choice, but Massow, despite his reasons for becoming re-involved, supported them on economic matters and felt that the 

Labour Party
 had its fair share of 
homophobes. Moreover, he wanted to put issues of intolerance, such as homophobia, behind them and end discrimination across the spectrum of political parties. However, he felt that his erstwhile friend 

William Hague
's support for 



Section 28


, a measure preventing the promotion of homosexuality in the classroom, was a step in the wrong direction. Many espousing  compassionate conservatism  were tested by this policy and other gay rights matters, leading to the defection of 
Shaun Woodward MP to Labour and 

John Bercow
 MP's resignation from the frontbench. Likewise Massow wanted to shame the party into change. 


Massow failed to change the party as he'd hoped and finally did this by following Woodward into the Labour Party in 2000, where he was welcomed by longtime friend 


Mo Mowlam

. Indeed, there was a large amount of press interest in his change of party, despite him having never held elected office or even stood for Parliament. However, his time in Labour was short-lived, he had no party political ambition. He resigned and attempted to stand again as Mayor of London in 2004 with his own movement  
Change London , although his name in the end never made it onto the ballot paper, his  Change London  campaign brought to the attention of the government and the mayor's office the potential long term effects on business of under-funding in transport and crime prevention. These were later incorporated into the Mayor's own campaign manifesto.




Contemporary art


In 1999, Massow became Chairman of London's influential Institute of Contemporary Arts. In January 2002, he wrote an article in the 

New Statesman
 magazine attacking his colleagues in the art world. He described contemporary conceptual art as  all hype and frequently no substance  and  the product of over-indulged, middle-class, bloated egos who patronise real people with fake understanding . He called the ICA a  pillar of the shock establishment . He attacked 


Tracey Emin

 saying she  couldn't think her way out of a paper bag . Although Massow was effectively sacked by the ICA for his comments, they marked a turning point in the arts debate which saw the arts world change direction from the purely conceptual work which had dominated the arts scene being unchallenged. Within a year, even government art ministers were echoing his statements, and the Turner Prize completely altered its nomination criteria. Subsequent winners included traditional craft-based artists such as the potter Grayson Perry. 


By February, Massow had resigned, forced out by the ICA Council. Subsequent interviews with Massow revealed that this was likely anyway, given his uncomfortable relationship with the ICA Director and his views on art. He has described the art world as bitchy and superficial, although he claims to actually like much conceptual art and acted in order to redress the imbalance between support for conceptual and  traditional  arts in the British art scene.


Massow subsequently set up the 
Institute of Contemporary Culture, a forum for artists supposedly free from  orthodoxy .




Media


Massow's relationship with the media started at the age of 21, when his good looks and charismatic appeal gained him the role of Financial Adviser at the launch of Channel 4's 'The Big Breakfast'. His entrepreneurial flair, far-sighted visionary style and often controversial opinions have meant that he's had a lengthy media career. His involvement in areas of public life from human rights issues to property restoration have meant that he is often consulted as a TV pundit.


Massow frequently writes in the UK press; from articles in broadsheets, including features in the Guardian or the Daily Telegraph and the 'Thunderer' column in the Times, to being an occasional comment writer for broad-sheet newspapers and magazines ranging from the New Statesman and The Spectator to FHM and GQ. He currently writes a monthly business advice column in Esquire magazine.  


Massow makes regular appearances on national television, from being the 'Entrepreneurial Expert' on Richard and Judy to shows such as Mariella Frostrup, BBC's Question Time and Newsnight. He was the subject of Inside the Mind of a Millionaire, a BBC documentary about entrepreneurship which featured his prison work. He was also the winner of Make Me a Million on Channel 4 in November 2005, a competition between 3 teams led by prominent entrepreneurs to 'make a million' in a year from a start-up company. 


Ivan is also a regular spokesman on national TV and radio on subjects from finance and gay rights to culture and mental health issues. Ivan is also regularly invited to speak at conferences and public meetings on entrepreneurship, human rights, art and social inclusion within the work place.




Charity


Massow has been involved with a number of charity initiatives since starting his business in 1990. This includes becoming the first mainstream business to sponsor London's Gay Pride festival at a time when it was largely shunned by commercial enterprises. 


Charity involvements and initiatives include founder/sponsor of  Insurance for Survivors    a coalition of four major charities whose aim is to increase awareness within the financial services industry of the problems encountered by survivors of mental health issues, cancer and major transplants. He was Chairman of MIND's inquiry into mental health and social exclusion and creator / coordinator of a Pre-Release scheme helping prisoners to start businesses for the Prince s Trust. This led to Massow giving lectures at Feltham YOI to prisoners interested in entrepreneurship.


He is a member of the  Entreprenologists , a group which investigates what defines an entrepreneur and how government can encourage/assist entrepreneurship in the UK. He is a Trustee of the  Entrepreneur s Working Party , a DTI/Treasury inspired initiative. This position inspired him to approach the Prince s Trust to create the prisons programme.


Massow is also creator/sponsor of the  Jake Network  (www.jaketm.com), a social/professional network in the UK which holds over 300 events a year in London for gay professionals, though he is known to keep a low profile and rarely attends events. 


Massow was a Patron of REGARD   a charity/support group helping gay people with physical disabilities. He founded of the April Bombing Appeal which raised cash for victims of the nail bombs in Soho, Brixton and Brick Lane in February 2000, raising cash to provide wheelchair access in homes and financial support for people unable to work as a result of their injuries.


Massow was a founder member of the  Me Too  anti-violence campaign with Elizabeth Vallance, Rabbi Julia Neuberger and Lord Saatchi. The campaign aims to provide a voice for people who want to promote social, racial and cultural difference as part of the UK national identity. 


Massow was a former member of the Samaritan s central marketing/fundraising team working on the Ambassador s Project and is a trained Samaritan. He is involved in a number of social and charity organisations and campaigns and a consultant to committees such as Stonewall and GALOP. He is Patron of the Salon des Arts   a gallery devoted to giving unknown artists a stage.


In the past Massow has sponsored a number of organisations including the Covent Garden Arts Festival, Stonewall FC (1st and 2nd teams) and the Terrence Higgins Trust, as a  Friend for Life . Massow was the main sponsor for the 2001 Stonewall Equality Dinner at the Savoy. He has also sponsored many gay pride events around the UK.

Keyboard instruments








Clavinova CVP-303





The Clavinova is a long-running line of 
digital pianos created by the 

Yamaha Corporation
. They are similar in styling to an 
acoustic 
piano, but with many features common to other digital pianos such as the ability to save and load songs, the availability of different voices, and, in more recent models, the ability to be connected to a computer via USB or wireless network.


The CLP range is aimed more towards those looking for a digital alternative to an acoustic piano and concentrates on accurately reproducing its touch and sound though most in the range also have a limited number of other voices available. The CVP range provides a greater variety of voices and also built-in rhythms and accompaniments enabling complete performances to be played and recorded using built-in sequencing software.



Technical information



Some Clavinovas (CLP and CVP-Series) feature graded hammer technology, a mechanical system of small metal hammers, weighted to be similar to those of a real 
pianoforte, which hit a digital pressure sensor that then translates into sound. This technology has contributed to the success of the Clavinova as a more affordable substitute for an acoustic piano. The 'Graded' action is intended to reproduce more accurately the varying weights of the hammers of an acoustic piano where the hammers vary in weight from the bass section to the treble. Newer Clavinovas, such as the CVP-407, incorporate real wood keys for added realism.


The built-in synthesizer produces the sound. The synthesizer contains samples of real instruments which are then selected and modified by the 
electronics to produce the desired sound. Information comes in a MIDI or similar format either directly from the piano keyboard or from a stored source (from within the piano or via a computer or external sequencer). The synthesizer can imitate a large array of acoustic instruments, electronic instruments and other sound effects. Recent models of CVP Clavinova have hundreds of such voices.  These usually include many types of pianos and organs, string, percussion, brass and woodwind instruments, as well as modern and vintage synthesizer sounds, sampled effects etc. The more recent CVP models also feature many accompaniment styles, ranging from traditional dance and classical orchestration, through to more modern club, pop, rock, big band and jazz styles.


The latest currently available models of the Clavinova are the CLP-3XX range and the CVP-30X range; the CVP-301 is the lower-end of the range, while the CVP-409 is the most expensive. The retail price of the CVP-409 is about US$12,000.

Alraune (disambiguation).

Alraune (German for Mandrake) is a novel by German novelist 










Hanns Heinz Ewers









 published  in 1911. It is also the name of the female lead character.



Legend


The basis of the story of Alraune dates to the Middles Ages in Germany. The 
humanoid-shaped 




Mandrake



 root or Mandragora officinarum was widely believed to be produced by the semen of 
hanged men under the 
gallows. 
Alchemists claimed that hanged men 
ejaculated after their 
necks were broken and that the earth absorbed their final  strengths . In some versions, it is blood instead of semen. The 
root itself was used in love 
philtres and 
potions while its 
fruit was supposed to facilitate 
pregnancy. Witches who  made love  to the Mandrake root were said to produce 
offspring which had no 
feelings of real 
love and had no 
soul.




Fiction


The novel deviates from the myth by concentrating on the issues of 
artificial insemination and individuality: 
genetics versus 





environment




. A scientist, Professor Jakob ten Brincken, interested in the laws of 
heredity, impregnates a prostitute in a 
laboratory with the semen of a hanged murderer. The prostitute conceives a female child who has no concept of love, whom the professor adopts. The girl, Alraune, suffers from obsessive sexuality and perverse 
relationships throughout her life. She learns of her unnatural origins and she revenges herself against the professor.


There have been a number of films based on the myth and the novel of Alraune.





 1918 - 

Alraune
, an 80 minute 

Hungarian
 movie which is now believed to be lost







 1918 - 

Alraune, die Henkerstochter, genannt die rote Hanne
, an 88 minute 

German
 movie directed by Eugen Illes


 1928 - 

Alraune
, also known as Unholy Love, a 125 minute black and white, silent German version directed by Henrik (Heinrich) Galeen. It starred 






Brigitte Helm





 as Alraune and Paul Wegener as the scientist Professor Jakob ten Brinken. It uses the novel and is regarded by critics as the definitive version of Alraune.  When this film was first shown in Britain, 
film censors removed the details of the woman's origins, thereby making the story and motivations confusing to British audiences.  







 1930 - Alraune, also known as The Daughter of Evil, a 103 minute black and white German version directed by 


Richard Oswald

 and again starring Brigitte Helm as Alma Raune (Alraune). This is the sound version of the above film.







 1952 - Alraune, or The Unnatural, a black and white German version directed by Arthur Maria Rabenalt. This had an all-star German cast including 






Hildegard Knef





 as Alraune and 


Erich von Stroheim

 as the scientist.




Several movies have shown the influence of the Alraune theme:














Embryo







 (1976)


The Species trilogy:



Species (1995)




Species II
 (1998)




Species III
 (2004)

Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta (
June 19, 
1417   
October 7, 
1468), popularly known as the Wolf of Rimini, was a famous member of the Italian 
House of Malatesta and lord of 










Rimini









, 










Fano









, and 










Cesena









 from 1432. He was widely considered by his contemporaries as one of the most daring military leaders in 



Italy


 and commanded the 

Venetian
 forces in the 1465 campaign against the 

Ottoman Empire
. He was also a 
poet and patron of the arts.


Biography


Sigismondo Pandolfo was born in 











Brescia










, northern 



Italy


, the illegitimate son of 

Pandolfo III Malatesta
 and Antonia Barignani.


Following the family's tradition, he debuted as man-at-arms at the age of 13 against his relative 
Carlo II Malatesta, lord of 












Pesaro











 and 
Pope Martin V's ally, who aimed to annex Rimini, Cesena and Fano to his territories. After his victory Sigismondo obtained, together with his brothers Galeotto Roberto and Domenico, the title of Papal vicar for those cities. In 1431, albeit with inferior forces, he repelled another invasion by the Malatestas of Pesaro. When his elder brother soon abdicated, he became lord of Rimini, at the age of only 15.


In 1432 he accepted the command of a Papal corps, defeating the Spanish condottiero Sante Cirillo and thwarting 

Antonio I Ordelaffi
's attempt to capture 
Forli (1435-36). However, the following year Sigismondo occupied the Papal city of 








Cervia







 and was excommunicated; he was soon pardoned and created commander of the Papal Army. Later he fought in 


Romagna

 and the 

Marche
 alongside 
Francesco Sforza. In the meantime he married Ginevra d'
Este, 
Niccolo III's illegitimate daughter. In 1440 she died, and rumours were that she had been poisoned by Sigismondo.1 Two years later he married Polissena Sforza, daughter of Francesco. In this period he scored a noteworthy victory against 
Niccolo Piccinino, managing to obtain some territories of Pesaro.



Fresco with 









Galeazzo Maria Sforza








 (right), by by 






Benozzo Gozzoli





.



In his restless attitude he betrayed Sforza twice, but he also betrayed his momentary ally against him, Niccolo Piccinino. Enmity against Sforza turned into true hatred when his father-in-law bought the seignory of Pesaro from Carlo Malatesta. Therefore Sigismondo allied with Pope 
Eugene IV and the 
duke of Milan. Later, he was hired by King 


















Alfonso V of Naples

















, but soon after received the money for the 
condotta passed at the service of 
Florence against the former. In 1445 he forced the Neapolitans to leave the siege of 
















Piombino















, in 

Tuscany
, and had his first son by Isotta degli Atti (whom he married to in 1456). In 1449 his wife Polissena died in mysterious circumstances. Francesco Sforza claimed Sigismondo had her drowned by one of his servants, but this has remained unconfirmed.


After 1449 Malatesta was variously under Venice, Florence, 
Siena, Naples and Sforza himself. The 
Peace of Lodi (1454), from which he was excluded, pushed the major Italian powers against him. His territories were repeatedly invaded by Aragonese, Venetian and Papal troops. On 
december 25, 
1460, a famous process in absentia was held in Rome against Sigismondo. Pope 
Pius II, who considered him guilty of treachery towards 

Siena
 arising from his long-running feud with 









Federico da Montefeltro








, duke of 

Urbino
, excommunicated him, declaring him a heretic and attributing to Sigismondo a series of sins (
incest, 
sodomy against his son 

Roberto
 and others) which smeared his reputation for centuries. 


A true crusade was then launched against Malatesta. The first contingent of Papal troops was defeated in the July 1461, but he was severely crushed on 





August 12




, 
1462 by Federico da Urbino near Senigallia. The war ended in 1463 with the loss of all Sigismondo's territories apart from Rimini and a territory of five miles around it: both however were to return to the Papal States after his death. He then sought more fortune as general for Venice in its war against the 
Ottomans, as a field commander in 
Peloponnesus (1464-1466).


In an attempt to reverse this situation, Sigismondo appears to have intended to murder Pius' successor, Pope 
Paul II (who had asked him to exchange Rimini for 





Spoleto




 and 














Camerino













), in 1468, but lost his nerve and returned to Rimini. He died in his residence of 
Castel Sismondo a few months later.


His son Roberto, also a skilled condottiero, managed briefly to maintain control over Rimini.

Pietro della Francesca.







Patron of art and reputation


Sigismondo's valour and skill as general were widely recognized by his contemporaries. According to the 












Catholic Encyclopedia












http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09566a.htm:
From his childhood he was a skilful and daring soldier, and throughout his life was regarded as almost the first captain in Italy


He was not a religious man, and his 
Tempio Malatestiano, also known as San Francesco,  built in Rimini, by 
Leon Battista Alberti and decorated by artists including 






Piero della Francesca





 and 






Agostino di Duccio





, was essentially a lay monument to 
Isotta degli Atti, his lover and third wife. It was a landmark 
Renaissance building, being the first church to use the Roman 
triumphal arch as part of its structure. Sigismondo also built a notable series of fortifications in his Romagna possessions, including the Rocche ( Castles ) of Rimini and Fano.


Malatesta's reputation (albeit minor) was largely based on 
Pius II's perception of him, although numerous contemporary chronicles described him as a tyrant and a womanizer: he delved in  rape, adultery, and incest .2 Italian Renaissance historian 










Francesco Guicciardini









 defined him  enemy of every peace and well-living .3 His deeds and political manoeuvers were characterized by all the typical play of violence, intrigues and subtleties typical of Renaissance Italy; however, Sigismondo was well aware of his sins, and tried to justify them in a series of love sonnets dedicated to Isotta.


In 1906, 
Edward Hutton published the historical novel Sigismondo Malatesta, mostly sympathetic to its hero. It was slightly revised and reprinted under the title The Mastiff of Rimini in 1926. 


Hutton's novel and 
Charles Emile Yriarte's Un condottiere au XV Siecle (1882) were among the main sources of American poet 


Ezra Pound

's Malatesta Cantos (
Cantos 8-11), first published in 1923. These are an admiring howbeit fragmentary account of Malatesta's career as warrior, lover and patron.


Largely infuenced by Pound, as well as by 
C. G. Jung, the critic 
Adrian Stokes devoted a study, The Stones of Rimini (1934), to the art created at Sigismondo's court.

Interstellar messages
SETI







This is the message with color added to highlight its separate parts. The actual binary transmission carried no color information.






The Arecibo message as decoded into 23 rows and 73 columns.



The Arecibo message was 
beamed via 
frequency modulated 
radio waves into space at a ceremony to mark the remodeling of the 

Arecibo radio telescope
 on 
16 November 
1974.1 It was aimed at the 
globular star cluster M13 some 25,000 
light years away because M13 was a large and close collection of stars that was available in the sky at the time and place of the ceremony.2 The message consisted of 1679 
binary digits, approximately 210 
bytes, transmitted at a frequency of 2380 
MHz and modulated by shifting the frequency by 10 Hz, with a power of 1000
kW.1 The 
cardinality was chosen because it is a 
semiprime3 (the product of two 
prime numbers), to be 
arranged rectangularly as 73 rows by 23 columns. The alternate arrangement, 23 rows by 73 columns, produces jumbled nonsense. The message forms the image shown on the right, or its inverse,3 when translated into graphics characters and spaces. The entire transmission lasted 1679 seconds and was not repeated.4

Dr. 

Frank Drake
, then at 

Cornell University
 and creator of the famous 
Drake equation, wrote the message, with help from 


Carl Sagan

, among others.1 The message consists of 7 parts that encode the following3:



the numbers one (1) through ten (10)


the 
atomic numbers of the elements 
hydrogen, 
carbon, 
nitrogen, 
oxygen, and 
phosphorus, which make up 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)


the 
formulas for the 
sugars and 






bases





 in the 
nucleotides of DNA


the number of nucleotides in DNA, and a graphic of the double helix structure of DNA


a graphic figure of a man, the dimension (physical height) of an average man, and the human population of Earth


a graphic of Earth's 
solar system


a graphic of the 

Arecibo radio telescope
 and the dimension (the physical diameter) of the transmitting antenna dish




Because it will take 25,000 years for the message to reach its intended destination of stars (and an additional 25,000 years for any reply), the Arecibo message was more a demonstration of human technological achievement than a real attempt to enter into a conversation with extraterrestrials.  In fact, the stars that the message was aimed at will no longer be there when it arrives.1 According to the Cornell News press release of Nov. 12, 1999, the real purpose of the message was not to make contact, but to demonstrate the capabilities of newly installed equipment.1



 Explanation 



 Numbers 





Part 1   The numbers from 1 to 10





1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  9  10
----------------------
0 0 0 1 1 1 1 00 00 00
0 1 1 0 0 1 1 00 00 10
1 0 1 0 1 0 1 01 11 01
X X X X X X X X  X  X -least-significant-digit marker




The numbers from 
1 to 
10 appear in 



binary


 format (the bottom row marks the beginning of each number).


Even knowing binary, the encoding of the numbers may not be immediately obvious due to the way they have been written. To read the first seven digits, ignore the bottom row, and read them as three binary digits from top to bottom, with the top digit being the most significant.


The readings for 8, 9 and 10 are a little different, as they have been given an additional column next to the first (to the right in the image). This is probably intended to show that numbers too large to fit in a column can be written in several contiguous ones, where the contiguous columns do not have the base marker.




 DNA elements 





Part 2   The elements constituting DNA





H C N O P
1 6 7 8 15
----------
0 0 0 1 1
0 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1
X X X X X




The numbers 1, 6, 7, 8 and 15 appear. These are the atomic numbers of 
hydrogen (H), 
carbon (C), 
nitrogen (N), 
oxygen (O), and 
phosphorus (P), the components of DNA.


The numbers 8 and 15 are written in a logical extension of binary encoding, rather than with the contiguous-columns method shown in the message's number figures at the top:




 Nucleotides 





Part 3   The nucleotides of DNA






Deoxyribose 
Adenine 
Thymine Deoxyribose
(C5OH7) (C5H4N5) (C5H5N2O2) (C5OH7)



Phosphate Phosphate
(PO4) (PO4)


Deoxyribose 
Cytosine 
Guanine Deoxyribose
(C5OH7) (C4H4N3O) (C5H4N5O) (C5OH7)


Phosphate Phosphate
(PO4) (PO4)




The 
nucleotides are described as sequences of the five atoms that appear on the preceding line. Each sequence represents the 
molecular formula of the nucleotide as incorporated into DNA (as opposed to the free form of the nucleotide).


For example, deoxyribose (C5OH7 in DNA, C5O4H10 when free), the nucleotide in the top left in the image, is read as:


11000
10000
11010
XXXXX
-----
75010


i.e. 7 atoms of hydrogen, 5 atoms of carbon, 0 atoms of nitrogen, 1 atom of oxygen, and 0 atoms of phosphorus.




 Double helix

DNA double 
helix (the vertical bar represents the number of nucleotides, but the value depicted is around 4.3 billion when in fact there are about 3.2 billion base pairs in the human genome).

= 4,292,853,750 (decimal)




The element in the center represents a human. The element on the left (in the image) indicates the average height of a person: 1764 
mm. This corresponds to the horizontally written binary 14 multiplied by the 
wavelength of the message (126 mm). The element on the right depicts the size of human population in 1974, around 4.3 billion. In this case, the number is oriented horizontally rather than vertically, with the least-significant-digit marker to the upper left in the image.




 Planets 





Part 6   The Sun and the planets





Earth

Sun and the planets in the order of their position from the 
Sun: 

Mercury

Venus, 
Earth, 
Mars, 
Jupiter, 
Saturn, 
Uranus, 
Neptune, and 

Pluto
. (Pluto is now classified as a 
dwarf planet, but was still considered a planet at the time the message was written.)


The Earth is the third planet from the 
Sun - its graphic is shifted up to identify it as the planet from which the signal was sent. The human figure is shown  standing on  the Earth graphic.


In addition to showing position, the graphic provides a general, not-to-scale size reference of each planet and the Sun.

The last part represents the 
Arecibo radio telescope with its 
diameter (2430 multiplied by the wavelength gives 306.18 
m). In this case, the number is oriented horizontally, with the least-significant-digit marker to the lower right in the image.

Routes








Intravenous



CARBOplatin is a 
chemotherapy 
drug used against some forms of 
cancer (mainly ovarian carcinoma, lung, head and neck cancers). It was introduced in the late 1980s and has since gained popularity in clinical treatment due to its vastly reduced side-effects compared to its parent compound 





Cisplatin




. Cisplatin and CARBOplatin, as well as 
oxaliplatin, are classified as 
DNA 
alkylating agents. 


History




Bristol-Myers Squibb
 gained 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for CARBOplatin, under the brand name Paraplatin, in March 1989. The drug went generic in October 2004.  There are also generic versions of the drug available from APP Pharmaceuticals, Bedford Laboratories, Sicor (

Teva
), Hospira, Pharmachemie, Pliva, 

Sandoz
, Spectrum.




Pharmacology



Chemistry


CARBOplatin differs from CISplatin in that it has a 
bidentate cyclobutane dicarboxylate (CBDCA) moiety as its leaving group in contrast to the more readily leaving chloro groups of CISplatin. This results in lower reactivity and DNA binding kinetics, though it forms the same reaction products in vitro at equivalent doses with CISplatin. However, recent studies provide a new caveat on the DNA binding molecular mechanisms  with the possibility of being activated by nucleophiles (as opposed to CISplatin), before forming the toxic adducts. There are also results to show that CISplatin and CARBOplatin cause different morphological changes in MCF-7 cell lines while exerting their cytotoxic behaviour.




Mode of action


Two theories exist to explain the molecular 
mechanism of action of CARBOplatin with DNA.



 Aquation, or the like-CISplatin hypothesis.


 Activation, or the unlike-CISplatin hypothesis.




The former is more accepted owing to the similarity of the leaving groups with its predecessor CISplatin, while the latter hypothesis envisages a biologically activation mechanism to release the active Pt2+ speciess.




Side-effects


The largest benefit of using CARBOplatin over CISplatin is the reduction of side effects; particularly the elimination of CISplatin's 
nephrotoxic effects.  This is due in part to the added stability of CARBOplatin in the bloodstream, which prevents proteins from binding to it. This in turn reduces the amount of these protein-CARBOplatin complexes to be excreted. The lower excretion rate of CARBOplatin means that more is retained in the body, and hence its effects are longer lasting (a retention half-life of 30 hours for CARBOplatin, compared to 1.5-3.6 hours in the case of CISplatin).



Nausea and 
vomiting are less severe and more easily controlled, compared to the incessant vomiting and antiperistalsis that some patients using CISplatin may experience.  CARBOplatin has also proven effective in some strains of cancer that may not be susceptible to CISplatin, including germ-line cell, small and non-small cell lung, ovary, and bladder cancers, as well as acute 
leukemia.


The main drawback of CARBOplatin is its myelosuppressive effects.  This causes the 
blood 
cell and 
platelet output of bone marrow in the body to decrease quite dramatically, sometimes as low as 10% of its usual production levels.  The nadir of this 
myelosuppression usually occurs 21-28 days after the first treatment, after which the blood cell and platelet levels in the blood begin to stabilize, often coming close to its pre-CARBOplatin levels.  This decrease in 
white blood cells (
neutropenia) can cause complications, and is  sometimes treated with drugs like 
filgrastim.  The most notable complication of neutropenia is increased probability of infection by opportunistic organisms, which necessitates readmission to hospital and treatment with 
antibiotics.


The potency of CARBOplatin also leaves something to be desired compared to CISplatin. Depending on the strain of cancer, CARBOplatin may only be 1/8 to 1/45 as effective as CISplatin.  The clinical standard of dosage of CARBOplatin is usually a 4:1 ratio compared to CISplatin; that is, for a dose that usually requires a particular dose of CISplatin, four times more CARBOplatin is needed to achieve the same effectiveness.  The stable property of CARBOplatin is a mixed blessing: although once uptake of the drug occurs, its retention half-life is considerably longer than CISplatin, it is also due to this inertness that causes CARBOplatin to go right through the human body, and up to 90% of the CARBOplatin given can be recovered in urine.


Recent studies have provided a way to increase the effectiveness of CARBOplatin by first incubating CARBOplatin in a 
sodium chloride (NaCl) solution.  After 24 hours, an analysis was performed on the solution by separating the compounds by thin-layer 
chromatography (TLC).  The TLC isolated CISplatin, CARBOplatin, and several platinum by-products in the solution.  Numerous trials were done, and the trend showed that the survival rate of 
E. coli dropped dramatically as the 
molarity of the NaCl incubating solution increased.  The treated E. coli also showed decreased amounts of alkaline phosphatase, a protein indicator of cellular size. This suggests that as this incubated CARBOplatin solution was administered to cells, they began to shrink and eventually die; apparently by the same mechanism that CISplatin works.





Current events


A recent study in mutant mice suggests that in the subset of women with breast cancer due to BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes (these cause a variety of familial breast cancer) CARBOplatin may be as much as 20 times more effective than the usual breast cancer treatments1 However, similar data in humans has not yet been shown.

Lie algebras




In 
mathematics,  a Cartan subalgebra is a 
nilpotent 
subalgebra \mathfrak{h} of a 

Lie algebra
 \mathfrak{g} that is 
self-normalising (if [X,Y] \in \mathfrak{h} for all X \in \mathfrak{h}, then Y \in \mathfrak{h}).

Cartan subalgebras exist for finite dimensional Lie algebras whenever the base field is infinite. If the field is algebraically closed of characteristic 0 and the algebra is finite dimensional then all Cartan subalgebras are conjugate under automorphisms of the Lie algebra, and in particular are all isomorphic. 


A Cartan subalgebra of a finite dimensional 
semisimple Lie algebra over an 
algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 is 
abelian and
also has the following property of its 
adjoint representation: the 
weight 
eigenspaces of \mathfrak{g} 
restricted to \mathfrak{h} diagonalize the representation, and the eigenspace of the zero weight vector is \mathfrak{h}.
The non-zero weights are called the 
roots, and the corresponding eigenspaces are called 
root spaces, and are all 1-dimensional. 



Kac-Moody algebras and 
generalized Kac-Moody algebras also have Cartan subalgebras. 


The name is for 
Elie Cartan.



Examples






Any nilpotent Lie algebra is its own Cartan subalgebra.


A Cartan subalgebra of the Lie algebra of 
n times;n matrices over a field is the algebra of all diagonal matrices. 


The Lie algebra sl2(R) of 2 by 2 matrices of trace 0 has two non-conjugate Cartan subalgebras.


The dimension of a Cartan subalgebra is not in general the maximal dimension of an abelian subalgebra, even for complex simple Lie algebras. For example, the Lie algebra sl2n(C) of 2n by 2n matrices of trace 0 has rank 2n minus;1 but has a maximal abelian subalgebra of dimension n2 consisting of all matrices of the form {0, A\choose 0, 0} with A any n by n matrix.  One can directly see this abelian subalgebra is not a Cartan subalgebra, since it is contained in the nilpotent algebra of strictly upper triangular matrices (which is also not a Cartan subalgebra since it is normalized by diagonal matrices).

SR





State Road 9336 is a two- to four-lane road in the 








U.S. state







 of 

Florida
. The route is the only signed four digit state route in Florida.


Excluding the easternmost two blocks, SR 9336 was (with 
SR 997) part of the former 
SR 27, which connected 




Flamingo, Florida



 in the Everglades to 
US 27.  The designation was changed in the early 1980s because of confusion between the state road and U.S. Highway.


Also, the route connects the 

Florida's Turnpike
 and 
US 1 (
SR 5) with the 

Everglades National Park
 SR 9336 is the primary mode of entrance to the park



State Road 906



While SR 27 (and, later, SR 9336) used West Palm Drive (Southwest 344th Street) going westward toward an access to Everglades National Park, SR 906 went eastward on East Palm Drive to provide an access to the visitor center of 

Biscayne National Park
.  The two State Roads met at the corner of Palm Drive and Krome Avenue (the current eastern terminus of SR 9336) in 

Florida City
, two blocks to the west of US 1.  An overhead sign on US 1 displayed directions to both National Parks and both State Roads.  The designation of SR 906 was established in 1945 and lasted until the mid-1980s, when it was merged with the east-west segment of the former 
SR 27 to form SR 9336, which was in turn shortened to its current configuration a decade later.


The former SR 906 still connects Biscayne National Park to US 1 and SR 9336 as it passes by Prime Outlets shopping mall, the Homestead Sports Complex, and the 







Homestead-Miami Speedway

Brian Eno









Here Come the Warm Jets is the debut solo album by 




Brian Eno



. Produced by Eno, it was released on 

Island Records
 in 1973. The musical styles of Here Come the Warm Jets differs from Eno's previous album work with 


Roxy Music

 and 



Robert Fripp


, with songs that are more quirky and experimental. The album featured various guest musicians, including Fripp, members of Roxy Music, 


Hawkwind

, 

Matching Mole
, and 
The Pink Fairies.


The album peaked at #26 on the UK album charts and #151 on the U.S. 
Billboard charts, receiving a number of positive reviews. It was re-issued on 
compact disc in 1990 on 

Island Records
 and in 2004 on 

Virgin Records
, and continued to elicit praise. Critic Steve Huey of 

Allmusic
 stated that the album  still sounds exciting, forward-looking, and densely detailed, revealing more intricacies with every play .1



Production


Here Come the Warm Jets was recorded in twelve days at Majestic Studios in 

London
 during September 1973 by recording engineer Derek Chandler.23  It was mixed at Air and Olympic Studios by Eno and 
audio engineer 






Chris Thomas





.3 The album's title was originally described by Eno as a slang term for 
urination.4 However, in an interview with Mojo magazine in 1996, Eno explained that it came from a description he wrote for the treated guitar on the title track; he called it  warm jet guitar...because the guitar sounded like a tuned jet. 56


Eno enlisted sixteen guest musicians to play on the album with him, including 

John Wetton
 and 



Robert Fripp


 of 



King Crimson


, 








Simon King







 from 


Hawkwind

, 








Bill MacCormick







 of 

Matching Mole
, 







Paul Rudolph






 of  


Pink Fairies

, and all the members of 


Roxy Music

 except vocalist 




Bryan Ferry



. Eno selected them on the basis that he thought they were incompatible with each other musically.2 He stated that he  got them together merely because I wanted to see what happens when you combine different identities like that and allow them to compete... [The situation] is organized with the knowledge that there might be accidents, accidents which will be more interesting that what I had intended .2


Eno directed the musicians by using body language and dancing, as well as through verbal suggestion, to influence their playing and the sounds they would emit. He felt that this was a good way to communicate with musicians at the time.7 The album credits Eno with instruments such as  snake guitar ,  simplistic piano  and  electric 
larynx . These terms were used to describe the sound's character or the means of production used to treat the instruments.2 After recording the individual tracks, Eno condensed and mixed the instrumentation deeply, resulting in some of the tracks bearing little resemblance to what the musicians recorded during the session.7




Style


The songs on Here Come the Warm Jets reference various musical styles from the past and present. The overall style of the album has been described as  glammed-up art-pop , showcasing 
glam rock's simple yet theatrical crunchy guitar rock and 
art-rock's sonic texture and 
avant-garde influences.8910   In some tracks, Eno's vocals emulate the manner of the lead singer of his former band 


Roxy Music

, 




Bryan Ferry



.2 On other songs such as  Baby's on Fire , they were described as  more nasal and slightly snotty vocals .1112  Musically, the album borrows from popular styles of the 
fifties such as the tinkling pianos and falsetto backing vocals on  Cindy Tells Me , and the drum rhythm of  Blank Frank , modelled after 


Bo Diddley

's song  




Who Do You Love?



 .2


To create the lyrics, Eno would later play these backing tracks singing nonsense syllables to himself, then taking them and forming them into actual words, phrases and meaning.7 This lyric-writing method was used for all his more vocal-based recordings of the 1970s.13 The lyrics on Here Come the Warm Jets are 
macabre with an underlying sense of humour.114 They are mostly 
free-associative and have no particular meaning. Exceptions include  The Paw Paw Negro Blowtorch , about someone having a love affair with a man from 

Paw Paw, Michigan
 whose breath causes things to catch on fire.14 Eno has attempted to dissuade fans from reading too much into his words; he claims that the song  Needles in the Camel's Eye  was  written in less time than it takes to sing...I regard [the song] as an instrumental with singing on it .15




Release and reception


The album was one of Brian Eno's best-selling releases, charting for two weeks and peaking at #26 on the 


UK Albums Chart

 on 
March 9, 
1974,16 and #151 on the U.S. 
Billboard charts.17 Eno would not achieve chart success again in the UK until the release of 

Music for Films
 on 
October 21, 
1978 and in the U.S. until 
Before and After Science the same year.1618 Initial critical reception for the album was mostly positive, praising its experimental tendencies.7 Critic 


Lester Bangs

 of 










Creem









 declared it  Incredible ,7 while 




Robert Christgau



 also of Creem gave it an  A  rating, stating that  The idea of this record--top of the pops from quasi-
dadaist British synth wizard--may put you off, but the actuality is quite engaging in a vaguely 
Velvet Underground kind of way. 19 The album was also placed in 

Circus
 magazine's section for  Picks of the Month .7 Cynthia Dagnal of 

Rolling Stone
 wrote an article on Eno, calling the album  a very compelling experiment in controlled chaos and by his own self-dictated standards a near success. 720 The next month, Gordon Fletcher wrote a negative review for the album in the  Records  section of Rolling Stone, stating  [Eno's] record is annoying because it doesn't do anything...the listener must kick himself for blowing five bucks on baloney. 2120


In 2004, 

Virgin Records
 began reissuing Eno's albums in batches of four to five.22 The 
remastered 
digipak release of Here Come the Warm Jets was released on 





May 31




, 
2004 in the UK and on 
June 1, 
2004 in North America.  Modern assessments of the album have been positive, 

Allmusic
, Rolling Stone and 

Uncut
 giving the album five stars, their highest ratings.231 In the November 2003 issue of Rolling Stone, the album charted at #436 on the magazine's top albums 500 albums of all time.24 In 2004, 

Pitchfork Media
 ranked the album at #24 on its list of  Top 100 Albums of the 1970s ,25 as well as giving the re-issue of the album 9.2 out of 10.26

Saint Paul's Bay (

Maltese
: San Pawl il-Ba ar) is situated in the north east of the island of 

Malta
, sixteen kilometres from the capital city 


Valletta

. 

Its name refers to the shipwreck of 
Saint Paul, as documented in the 






Acts of the Apostles





, due to the tradition that Saint Paul was 
shipwrecked on the isles, named St. Paul's Isles, which are situated in St Paul's Bay.

The resident population in November 2005 stood at 13,619 persons. This population goes up to about 60,000 during the period of June to September. The increase is due both to Maltese summer residents and 
tourists lodging in 
hotels, especially in Bu ibba and Qawra.

The Second Battle of Winchester was fought between 
June 13 and 
June 15, 
1863 in 

Frederick County
 and 

Winchester, Virginia
 as part of the 
Gettysburg Campaign during the 

American Civil War
. As 




Confederate



 
Lieutenant General 

Richard S. Ewell
 moved down the 






Shenandoah Valley





 in the direction of 





Pennsylvania




, his corps defeated the 
Union Army garrison commanded by 
Major General 











Robert H. Milroy










, capturing Winchester and numerous Union prisoners.



 Background 



After the 

Battle of Brandy Station
, 
June 9, 
1863, Confederate General 

Robert E. Lee
 ordered Ewell's 19,000-man 
Second Corps, 

Army of Northern Virginia
, to clear the lower Shenandoah Valley of Union opposition so that Lee's army could proceed on its invasion of 
Pennsylvania, shielded by the 


Blue Ridge Mountains

 from Union interference.


General-in-chief 

Henry Wager Halleck
 expressed great concerns about the Middle Department's defensive strategy for its primary objective of protecting the 
Baltimore and Ohio Railroad corridor.1 Brig. Gen. 


















Benjamin Franklin Kelley

















, commander of the  railroad division  (Department of Harper's Ferry), had been advised that his plan along with Maj. Gen. Milroy's and Maj. Gen. 
















Robert C. Schenck















's (Commander of the Middle Department) was unsound:


Headquarters Eighth Army Corps,Baltimore, 





January 5




, 
1863.
The following telegram was received to-day from Major-General Halleck, General-in-Chief:
 Major-General Schenck: No attempt should be made to hold Winchester against a large force of the enemy ... 
General Halleck does not quite agree with General Schenck and yourself as to the policy of covering and protecting the road principly by keeping up advanced posts at Leesburg, Winchester and Romney.


   WM. D. WHIPPLE, Assistant Adjutant-General.2

Andrew T. McReynolds and 
William G. Ely, and two small outposts northwest of town under Col. 
Joseph W. Keifer.





 Preliminary maneuvers 




Army of Northern Virginia (A.N.Va.) movement


Ewell's movements were coordinated as part of an overall orchestration of the Army of Northern Virginia into position for crossing the 



Potomac River


 toward Pennsylvania by using the Blue Ridge Mountains as a screen. This strategic offensive maneuver was put into effect on 
3 June, when Gen. Robert E. Lee stated his intent to  transfer the scene of hostilities beyond the Potomac , by moving in a concealed fashion down the Shenandoah Valley.


Longstreet's First Corps (via 

Snickers Gap
) and Hill's Third Corps (via 
Ashby's Gap) paralleled the movements of Second Corps to the east through 

Berryville, Virginia
, and Stuart's Cavalry Division was under orders for careful synchronization and screening for Lee's Army by conducting demonstrations and screening actions along the ANV's right flank east of the Blue Ridge.



Ewell's Second Corps movements





June 4-11 : The Second Corps left Hamilton's Crossing on 
4 June and marched to 

Culpeper, Virginia
, arriving 
7 June. Receiving intelligence that Union forces had crossed the 



Rappahannock River


 in force, Lee ordered Ewell northeast to 









Brandy Station, Virginia








 on 
9 June, to support Major General 

J.E.B. Stuart
's actions in the 

Battle of Brandy Station
, only to find the Union forces already retreating. Ewell resumed the march on 
10 June, and on 
11 June Early and Johnson's Divisions marched via the Sperryville turnpike to Gaines crossroads, while Rodes' Division took the Richmond road toward Flint Hill.3 On the evening of the 11th, after consulting with General Lee, Ewell met with Early, Johnson and the Second Corps topographer, Jedediah Hotchkiss, to discuss approach routes, and a general plan for the Second Corps' objective to capture Winchester and 

Martinsburg
.4







June 12 : The Second Corps passed through 
Chester's Gap southeast of 

Front Royal, Virginia
, approaching along the Front Royal Pike (modern U.S. 522). There the Second Corps was joined by its cavalry brigade under the command of Brig. Gen. 

Albert G. Jenkins
. Ewell consulted with Early and Jenkins to form his corps-level plan of action, composed of splitting the corps into two basic independent movements:5







 North intercept   cut-off maneuver to Berryville   Martinsburg:


 Units: Rodes' Division and Jenkins' cavalry brigade


 Direction of movement: detached north through 

Berryville, Virginia
 to 

Martinsburg, West Virginia



 Ewell's objective: To capture, if possible, McReynolds' force of 1,800 men stationed at Berryville and then to press north to Martinsburg







 Main strike maneuver to Winchester:


 Units: Early's Division, Johnson's Division and the 16th Virginia Cavalry Battalion (Maj. James H. Nounnan) of Jenkins' Brigade


 Direction of movement: Northwest to 

Winchester, Virginia



 Ewell's objective: To attack the fortifications in Winchester and Milroy's force of 6,000 to 8,000 men




By the end of the day on 
12 June, Rodes' Division was five miles north of Front Royal, encamped at Stone Bridge, while Johnson's Division arrived at Cedarville, and Early's Division was encamped near the 



Shenandoah River


.





Milroy's defensive preparations



Berryville outpost


By April, four months into his occupation of Winchester, Milroy's loose grip on Confederate raiding in the lower Shenandoah Valley caused enough concern for the Middle Department commander, Schenck, to directly order Milroy to post one brigade further to the east at Berryville. It offered a base of operations to patrol crossings of the 



Shenandoah River


 and lookout for Confederates raiding in and out of both Snicker's Gap and Ashby's Gap in the Blue Ridge Mountains on the eastern border of the valley.6 In response, Milroy posted McReynolds' brigade in Berryville, with orders to evacuate to Winchester upon the signal of the firing of one of the heavy artillery guns.




Cavalry defenses


Milroy stationed pickets and videttes around Winchester, but they were positioned so close to Winchester, due to bushwacking of his patrols,7 that Milroy had practically no surveillance of the situation around himself. His caution in posting outlying videttes was also perhaps due to the severe losses he incurred in trying to suppress various Confederate cavalry raids that kept occurring in his district, such as on 
26 February, when he sent the 1st New York Cavalry and the 13th Pennsylvania Cavalry out to pursue raiders. They met the 7th and 11th Virginia Cavalry, under the command of Col. O. R. Funsten, and suffered a devastating loss of 197 Federal cavalry, including 12 officers.8 Milroy also often recorded many other grand-sounding cavalry incursions supposedly capturing or killing many of Colonel 

















John S. Mosby
















's rangers in the weeks and months leading up to June; however, the records of Mosby's Rangers do not corroborate or mention most of these engagements9 Milroy's farthest outlying videttes to the south were located at or near Parkins Mill Battery at the 



Opequon Creek


 crossing, a mere four miles south of Winchester.10 Other reports of Federal videttes to the west of Winchester were never seen or encountered by Confederate forces.




Fortifications





MajGen. Milroy's defensive fortifications in Winchester, Virginia in June, 1863.





Winchester was heavily fortified by forts and 
lunettes circumferencing the town, as well as along the outlying turnpike routes entering town. Within Winchester, Milroy constructed or improved ten defensive fortifications, numbered Battery No. 1 through Battery No. 10, making improvements on many pre-existing forts and fortifications left by prior Confederate and Federal occupations. The fortifications were linked in places with roads and trenches, and the use of these were a key to Milroy's defensive strategy. Through a combination of retreating his forces into the defensive works, and then using his long-range heavy artillery, Milroy felt that he could hold out for weeks (if not months) against any force that may be thrown against him.


During the battle, Milroy concentrated his forces on the ridges west of town in his three highest and most improved forts connected by trenches. The larger forts were named:



 Battery No. 2 - Fort Milroy: Originally built by Confederate troops and called the  fortification on the heights  or the  Main Fort , this was improved under Maj. Gen. Banks and called  Fort Garibaldi  by the 39th New York regiment. The fort was improved extensively by Milroy's troops and held 14 guns, including heavy artillery, and renamed Fort Milroy (but then renamed Fort Jackson after the battle).


 Battery No. 3 - Star Fort: This fort was built by Federal troops in 1862, improved by Milroy, and equipped with 8 guns.  (Renamed Fort Alabama).


 Battery No. 5 - West Fort: This was a 4-gun lunette located due west of Fort Milroy (later renamed Louisiana Heights)




The lesser fortifications initially used, but abandoned by Milroy during the course of the battle were:



 Battery No. 1: A linear entrenchment-lunette along Bower's Hill south of Fort Milroy (Battery 2).


 Battery No. 4: A large star lunette with entrenchments and minor lunettes containing 6 guns, located due north of Star Fort (Battery 3) along the same ridge line (north of moder VA 37).


 Battery No. 6: A small lunette with 2 guns on a hill peak located in between West Fort (Battery 5) and Battery 7 (modern exit of VA 37 onto VA 522).


 Battery No. 7: A large lunette and trench line with 8 guns on Apple Pie Ridge west of Apple Pie Ridge Road (modern James Wood High School).


 Battery No. 8: A grouping of two redans downhill west of Star Fort (Battery 3).


 Battery No. 9: Unknown location.


 Battery No. 10: this was the Confederate Fort Collier built on the east side of the Martinsburg turnpike on the north end of town.


 Fortification at Opequon Crossing (Parkins Mill Battery): A lunette or redan 4 miles south of Winchester at the Opequon River crossing on the Front Royal turnpike (modern VA 522).

The Occupation of Major General Robert Milroy














 Main battle 




June 13: initial engagements



Ewell's attack plan


Ewell and his generals were well acquainted with the tactical situation in Winchester, having fought through here under Lt. Gen. Jackson during the 

First Battle of Winchester
, and understood the layout of the various fortifications and terrain masking opportunities on the west side of town. Therefore, Ewell further split his main attack force of two divisions into two basic flanking movements:





 West (Left) Flanking Movement


 Units: Early's Division, Brown's artillery battalion, 1st Maryland Infantry Battalion and the Baltimore Light Artillery


 Direction: West to Newton, on the Valley Pike


 Ewell's objective: Approach Winchester from the southwest, and seek flanking avenues of approach from the west and northwest ridges of town







 East (Right) Flanking Movement


 Units: Johnson's Division, 16th Virginia cavalry battalion


 Direction: Northwest to Winchester on the Front Royal Pike


 Ewell's objective: Perform demonstrations moving north along the east side of Winchester to  divert attention 11 from Early's movements






Johnson's Division advances on the Front Royal Pike


Johnson's division, while moving northwest on the Front Royal Pike, drove back Federal pickets at the Opequon River crossing (Parkins Mill Battery) around 8:30 a.m., and engaged in cavalry skirmishes at Hoge Run around 9:30 a.m.12 Johnson's advance stalled under fire from Fort Milroy's heavy guns shortly before noon, and skirmishing and artillery engagements commended afterward with Federal artillery located on the hill near Hollinsworth Mill.13 Johnson held his position at that point to synchronize with the arrival of Early's Division.




Early's Division advances on the Valley Pike


Ewell ordered Early's Division to cross west via Ninevah to 

Newtown
 and move north on the 







Valley Pike






. Arriving at the outskirts of 




Kernstown



 light infantry and artillery engagements commenced around noon. Late in the afternoon, around 4 p.m., Early pushed back Federal skirmishers at the Valley Pike toll-gate14 and after minor engagements, the Federal forces retreated north of 



Abrams Creek


.




Milroy concentrates into his forts


Milroy, despite the engagements up to point, still had no idea that he was facing the entire Second Corps of Lee's Army. Milroy concentrated all of his forces in the three forts defending the town. Having feared exactly this type of a scenario, General-in-chief 
Henry W. Halleck had asked Schenck to order Milroy to fall back from Winchester to 
Harpers Ferry. Although Schenck had discussed evacuation with Milroy, he left no clear direction for Milroy to evacuate, since Milroy had convinced Schenck that his defensive position in Winchester was strong. Milroy had previously decided to disregard concerns from Washington because he was confident that the strength of his fortifications would allow his garrison to withstand an assault or a siege.




Rodes' Division advances on Berryville and Martinsburg


Ewell, based on good intelligence from sources in the lower Valley, had foreseen that Milroy's only escape route could be successfully blocked and had already anticipated by having Rodes' Division advance on Martinsburg via Berryville to cut off Milroy's expected retreat route, per his plans from 
11 June. That afternoon, having reached Berryville, Rodes' Division and Jenkins' cavalry brigade attempted to capture McReynolds' Brigade, but, alerted to the Confederate movement by the firing of signal guns by Milroy's main force in Winchester, McReynolds withdrew to Winchester, where his force occupied the Star Fort north of town. Nevertheless, the Confederates were able to capture portions of the Federal supply train at nearby 




Bunker Hill, West Virginia



, along with 75 prisoners. Subsequently Confederate forces cut the telegram line into Winchester, eliminating Milroy's only line of communication, and by sundown on 13 June Rodes' Division had reached Martinsburg, capturing the town along with five Federal artillery pieces.15 The night of 
13 June a storm arose, and a strong rain drenched Winchester and the lower Valley all night long.16





June 14: Ewell's double-flank Attack



Early's left flanking march to Apple Pie Ridge


At dawn on 
June 14, Gordon's Brigade swept forward to capture Bower's Hill with little resistance. Johnson extended his line to the right against very light opposition; there was fitful skirmishing in the streets of Winchester. Early and Ewell conferred on Bower's Hill and decided on a flanking strategy. Gordon's Brigade and two batteries were left on Bower's Hill, while Early led his three other brigades back to Cedar Creek Grade, west beyond Apple Pie Ridge where it was out of view of Federal fortifications, then north over Cloverdale Plantation to Walnut Grove. His column was accompanied by 20 guns. While Early made this march, Johnson advanced a line of skirmishers on the right to occupy the Federals' attention, providing diversionary skirmishing all day from 10 a.m. until about 4 p.m. The Confederate batteries on Bower's Hill opened up, touching off a duel with the Federal guns in Fort Milroy. By mid-afternoon, Early's force had gained a position opposite West Fort on Apple Pie Ridge. Eight guns were positioned on the Brierly Farm northwest of the fort, while 12 guns were placed in an orchard southwest of the fort, but by this time the field had quieted. Within the Federal forts, Milroy and his sub-commanders believed that the Confederates had been repulsed from Winchester, still seemingly unaware they were now totally surrounded and cut off, with the additional problem of an entire division (Rodes') occupying their primary escape route north.




Early's attack on West Fort


About 6 p.m.,17 Early's artillery opened fire on West Fort. The twenty guns fired for 45 minutes, while Hays stealthily advanced his Louisiana brigade through the corn and wheat fields at the base of Apple Pie Ridge. On command, the brigade rushed forward across 300 yards of open fields and swept upward into the works. After a brief hand-to-hand struggle, the Federal defenders abandoned the works, retreating to Fort Milroy, while their own captured artillery were turned around and used against them.18 Hays was supported in the attack by Smith's and Avery's brigade, and Early consolidated his line on West Fort (or Flint) Ridge, but darkness prevented further gains. An artillery duel continued until long after dark. After the battle, Ewell christened West Fort Ridge as  Louisiana Heights  in honor of Hays's brigade. That evening, Ewell located his Corps Headquarters at the Bowers' House, while Early's Division pounded away at Milroy's main fort in an artillery duel well into the night.19




Johnson's right flanking march toward Stephenson's Depot


Ewell assumed that Milroy might attempt a retreat during the night and ordered Johnson to prevent his escape by marching north and cutting off escape to the east-north-east via the Charles Town Road, a potential escape route that could possibly bypass the position of Rodes' Division in the north. Therefore, about 9 p.m., Johnson (with Steuart's and Williams's brigades and 8 guns) commenced a night march north to Berryville Pike and west to Jordan Springs Road, where he turned north toward Stephenson's Depot, a train stop on the Winchester and Potomac Railroad near the intersection of the Martinsburg Pike and the Charles Town Road. About midnight, the 




Stonewall Brigade



 disengaged and joined the rear of the column, leaving one brigade (Jones) astride the Berryville Pike east of town.




Milroy retreats up the Martinsburg Pike


Also at 9 p.m., at a formal 
council of war, Milroy and his officers made the decision to try to  cut their way through  to Harpers Ferry on the old Charles Town Road, the very same road that Confederate Johnson and his division were marching toward to cut off. All of the cannons were spiked and their carriages destroyed. Shortly after midnight, the Federal soldiers pulled their colors and left their works so quietly that Early's Confederates did not know they were gone until morning. The column massed in the low ground between Star Fort and Fort Milroy, then moved down along the railroad line and the Valley Pike toward the Charles Town crossroad, just south of Stephenson's Depot.





June 15: Johnson's attack at Stephenson's Depot


Near dawn on 
June 15, Johnson's skirmishers encountered the head of Milroy's retreating column near the intersection of the Valley Pike and old Charles Town road. Milroy faced his column to the right on the pike and prepared to fight his way out of a  murderous trap  by enveloping the enemy. Johnson deployed his regiments along Milburn Road as they came up and advanced to the railroad and placed two guns on either side of the Charles Town Road railroad bridge. The rest of the artillery was deployed on the heights east of Milburn Road. As it grew light, Federal forces made several desperate but uncoordinated attacks against the bridge and railroad embankment. The Confederates were being steadily reinforced and repulsed each attempt. Nicholl's Brigade crushed the final Federal attack and the Stonewall Brigade then came up in line of battle north of the road and advanced to cut the Valley Pike. This was the final blow; and some remaining Federal regiments hoisted the white flag. At some point Milroy's horse was shot out from under him, and the Division as a whole scattered in various directions to the northwest, north, and northeast, with some small groups even managing to escape covertly to the southeast toward and through 

Manassas Gap
 into Federally-controlled territory.





 Aftermath 




Casualty reports


Both Union and Confederate Official Record reports on casualties are practically identical. Ewell reported:





  The fruits of this victory were 23 pieces of artillery (nearly all rifled), 4,000 prisoners, 300 loaded wagons, more than 300 horses, and quite a large amount of commissary and quartermaster's stores. 20




This prisoner count seems to include the capture of all the Federal wounded hospitalized in Winchester, since Ewell's topographer, Jedediah Hotchkiss counts about 2,000 prisonors from the town, along with an estimate of about 1,500 that escaped to Harper's Ferry, along with more prisoners captured during pursuits from the Confederate cavalry. When Milroy appeared later in Harpers Ferry, he was immediately placed under arrest. Shortly after Schenck reported Milroy's arrest had expired, Aide-de-Camp Capt. Frederick A. Palmer, 18th Connecticut Infantry, reported in an extensive and detailed table of all units, summarized:21





 Killed: 7 Officers, 88 Enlisted men, Wounded: 12 Officers, 336 Enlisted men, Captured or missing: 144 Officers, 3856 Enlisted men.




Thus, while Ewell reports 4,000 captured,the 

VIII Corps
 reports 144 Officers and 3856 Enlisted men missing or captured, which also adds to 4,000. Captain Palmer summarized the Union losses at a total of 4,443 for 1st, 2nd and 3rd Brigades from the 2nd Division, VIII Corps including all independent attachments.


Johnson's Division, alone, captured 3,500 prisoners in the action at Stephenson's Depot, and this is not surprising, since this is the only major engagement of the war in which an entire Division column was attacked at night while rout marching on a road. General Johnson claimed to have taken 30 prisoners  with his opera glass!  as well as  11 stands of colors, 175 horses, and arms and accoutrements of every description .22


Some casualty estimates range lower. Eicher writes that Confederate casualties were 269 (47 killed, 219 wounded, 3 missing); Union 3,801 (95 killed, 348 wounded, 3,358 missing or captured).23 Difficult to account for in the records are additional numbers of captured Union soldiers from the many hospitals in Winchester.24


The casualty ratio in this engagement of two divisions against one was an amazing 269 to 4,443 or 0.06 ... the most lopsided for an engagement of this size in the entire war. It's no wonder that Confederate artillerist Maj. Robert Stiles wrote,  This battle of Winchester ... was one of the most perfect pieces of work the Army of Northern Virginia ever did. 




A division lost, two battalions gained


Milroy and his staff, his cavalry, and other small units, totaling about 1,200 escaped to Harpers Ferry. Additionally, in the days following the battle  2,700 more turned up in Bloody Run, Pennsylvania 25 Milroy's command ceased to exist, and the scattered remnants of what was the 2nd Division, VIII Corps were assimilated back into the Middle Department, while Milroy was placed under arrest. The Confederates had merely hoped to re-supply and forage, but with the easy capture of Winchester, they captured enough artillery and horses to equip a battalion of infantry and cavalry, including 28 guns (23 at Winchester and 5 at Martinsburg) and 300 horses in total.26 Additionally, the Confederates captured a great quantity of food, clothing, small arms ammunition and medical stores in Winchester.


Following this battle, a Court of Inquiry was held, and both President Abraham Lincoln and Halleck desired to know who disobeyed the orders to  evacuate Winchester . President Abraham Lincoln wrote to Milroy:


Major General Milroy
I have never doubted your courage and devotion to the cause... but... I have scarcely seen anything from you at any time that did not contain imputations against your superiors and a chafing against acting the part they have assigned you. You have constantly urged the idea that you were persecuted because you did not come from West Point, and you repeat it in these letters. This, my dear general, is, I fear, the rock on which you have split...



   Abraham Lincoln, 29 June 186327



The nature of the inquiry was later changed from investigating who disobeyed orders to evacuate Winchester, to the discovery of the events and nature of the retreat from Winchester. Milroy was exonerated and claimed that his brilliant defensive action at Winchester was instrumental in causing the timing of the 

Battle of Gettysburg
, leading to the overall Union victory for the campaign. Despite this, Halleck insisted that Milroy not be given any more commands.




Contribution to Lee's 
Gettysburg Campaign


The victory at Second Winchester cleared the Valley of Federal troops and opened the door for Lee's second invasion of the North. The capturing of ample supplies justified Lee's conceptual plan to provision his army on the march. The Federal defeat stunned the North, and 



Secretary of War


 

Edwin M. Stanton
 called for additional militia to be federalized. Shortly afterwards, President Lincoln requested 100,000 volunteers to repel the threatened invasion. Several fleeing members of the scattered 87th Pennsylvania hastily tramped back to their homes near Gettysburg and in adjoining 

York County, Pennsylvania
, spreading news to local officials that the Confederates were now in the Valley in strength, with apparent designs on invading Pennsylvania. Gov. 
Andrew Curtin of Pennsylvania, in response to these reports and other military intelligence, called for 50,000 volunteers to protect the Keystone State.28




Ewell's followup


Immediately following the battle, Ewell dispatched the entire Corps cavalry brigade under Jenkins on a raid to 

Chambersburg, Pennsylvania
, to forage and reconnoiter. Ewell placed his Second Corps Headquarters about 3 miles north of Winchester and then at Mr. Boyd's house near Bunker's Hill.29 The captured flag of Fort Milroy was used to create a new Confederate flag, and Ewell and Early attended a christening ceremony in which the new flag was hosted, and the fort officially renamed  Fort Jackson  in honor of the recently slain former Second Corps commander. Topographer Jedediah Hotchkiss then commenced an all day survey,30 creating his now famous map of the battle which appears at the head of this article.




Leadership contribution


Jubal Early's leadership in this battle was superb. Later, Lee had the utmost confidence in Early, ultimately giving him not just the Confederate Second Corps, but a new Valley District army to try again, in 1864, the distracting demonstration invasion of the United States that Lee had always dreamed of. Early succeeded, where Lee failed twice at Sharpsburg and Gettysburg, and shelled Fort Stevens in Washington, D.C. in a noble and last desperate attempt to free the south.

Kheyvis was a 
nightclub in 
Olivos, Buenos Aires, 


Argentina

. On 
20 December 
1993, a fire in the club caused the deaths of 17 teenagers in a graduation party of the La Salle College. It is believed to have been caused by the burning of 
furniture as a prank, although no one was charged with starting it.

The Kheyvis fire led to tougher regulations, including mandatory 
emergency exits and extensive security inspections of existing nightclubs. Until the 
Republica Cromagnon fire on 
30 December 
2004 in Buenos Aires, the Kheyvis fire was the worst nightclub tragedy in Argentine history.

Troy Donockley is an 

English
 player of 
uillean pipes.



Donockley with You Slosh in 1991





 Rejection of pop 



Troy was born on 30th May 1964.1 in 

Workington
 in 
Cumbria. His father and mother were members of a band called Travelling Country. At the age of 16 Troy joined them, playing at many venues in West Cumbria. His father's record collection was broad and gave Troy a love of classical as well as traditional music. He is one of the few Englishmen who are master of the uillean pipes. Additionally he plays 
guitar, 
flute, 
bouzouki, low whistle and keyboards. His ambition was to travel the world as a musician, but hated  empty pop created by cynical twerps . The strangeness of the sound of the uilleann pipes enabled him to become a session musician with prog-rockers 

The Enid
 in 1987 on their album The Sower and the Seed.




 Celtic New Age 





Donockley on guitar with You Slosh in 1991



In 1987 he joined You Slosh2, recording Glorious Racket with them in 1989. In the following year he recorded as a session musician with 

Iona
, a band which explores the influence of the Celtic Church. This was at the very beginning of the boom in new age bands, and both ventures were very successful. Troy recorded one more album with You Slosh in 1991 plus nine more Iona albums. He became an official member of the group in 1995. 
Maire Brennan, a member of the best-known new age group, 


Clannad

, called on Troy to be a session musician on Two Horizons. Kathryn Tickell plays the Northumbrian smallpipes. Troy made Debataeable Lands3 with her in 1999, contrasting two types of bagpipe.




 Maddy and Barbara 



Both 

Barbara Dickson
 and 



Maddy Prior


 live in the north of England so it was almost inevitable that Troy would meet them. Alongside her easy listening albums, Barbara Dickson also records folk albums. In 1994 and again in 2004 Troy was a session musician for Barbara's folk albums. After recording Flesh and Blood with Maddy Prior in 1997, Troy became co-producer of her next four solo albums. He gave a prog-rock feel to material that is mainly traditional.




 Session work 



Troy Donockley has recorded as a 
session musician with 













Roy Harper












, 

Del Amitri
 and 
Status Quo. Martin Allcock, a member of 


Fairport Convention

 has recorded an album of his own songs, with Troy playing on it. Bruce Johnson of 
the Beach Boys has used him. Five albums by prog-rockers 

Mostly Autumn
 feature him. He also performed on  Etarlis,  a 2007 release by 


Mermaid Kiss

 and on 

Dark Passion Play
, the newest album of the Finnish symphonic metal band 


Nightwish

. He also accompanied the band on their current tour and features on the music video for the single  





The Islander




 . Notably, he also performed at the Scottish leg of 

Live 8
 with 











Midge Ure










.




 Classical ambitions 



Troy has composed music for choir and orchestra. He has gone to great lengths to find the right kind of studio production. The Unseen Stream (1998) and The Pursuit of Illusion (2003) put the uilleann pipes in a sound mix that has never been heard before. If they are ever performed live, they will be expensive. Recently this unique combination was recognized by Maksim, who commissioned Troy to compose, arrange and produce a standout titled Nathrach on Maksim's most recent album, Electrik.

Between 1888 and the 1970s, 

Canada
 was placed second in the world in terms of sheer number of 
skyscrapers . The tallest were located in Canada's biggest cities such as 

Toronto
, 

Montreal
 and 

Vancouver
, but up to fifteen skyscrapers were found in 

Winnipeg
, most of which were built before 1920. In 1939, there were hundreds of high-rises in Canada, Many of them located in Montreal, which was enjoying a boom, but the tallest ones were found in Toronto. 


Here is list of skyscrapers, churches, and other notable buildings found in Canada and built between 1809 and 1939.


An asterisk ( * ) in the Building field indicates that the building has been destroyed. An asterisk in the Height field indicates an estimation.

Palisades Interstate Park system




Blauvelt State Park is located in the 
Town of Orangetown in 

Rockland County, New York
, not far from the 



Hudson River


. The park is south of 

Nyack, New York
. 

This is an undeveloped park with no facilities other than hiking trails and limited parking.  The park links with several other town and county parks, including Clausland Mountain Park, Buttermilk Falls Park, Tackamack Park and the Schuyler/Bradley Park, creating a largely seamless park range on the palisades.  The Long Path, a hiking trail linking Fort Lee, New Jersey to the Adirondacks of New York, travels through the park.  The park offers several outlooks over the Hudson River and the Tappan Zee.  Finally the park contains the ruins of an abandoned World War I rifle range, Camp Bluefields.  The tunnels that connected the down range targets to the firing line remain.  The adjacent Clausland Mountain Park and Nike Site is the former home of a Nike missile launch site.  During the Cold War the site was part of a ring of Nike surface to air missiles surrounding New York City intended to defend New York City from Soviet bombers. 


An article about Blauvelt, NY, by Firth Haring Fabend appears in South of the Mountains (The Historical Society of Rockland County), Vol. 50, No. 2, April-June 2006. The title is  From Jan Claus' Land to 'tGreynbos to Greenbush to Blauveltville to Blauvelt.

an Navy Saar 4












The Saar 4 or Reshef class 
missile boats were built at the Israel shipyards and based on 






Israeli Navy





 designs grounded in accumulated experience derived in the operation of  Cherbourg  (



Saar 3


) class.


Saar 4 ships first battle engagements were made in the October 
1973 

Yom Kippur War
. During this war, two Saar 4 ships engaged in missile battles with 

Egypt
ian and 

Syria
n ships and coastal targets.



Variants


The Warrior class strike craft (ex Minister class) in service with the 
South African Navy are modified Saar IV (Reshef class) fast attack craft.1  In 1974, a contract was signed with Israeli Defence Industries for the construction of three of the modified Reshef class vessels at the 
Haifa facility of Israeli Shipyards.  A further three were built immediately after at the Sandock Austral shipyard in 

Durban
, South Africa, with three more being built at the same facility several years later.2 The imposition of the 




international embargo on the sale of arms to South Africa



 on 4 November 
1977 forced the project to be carried out under a cloak of high security.2  The South African variants were fitted with 

Gabriel missile
s, otherwise known as 'Scorpion' missiles, and had two 

Oto Melara
 guns instead of a single one with a 













Phalanx CIWS












.


In 2000, two of the Israeli boats were sold to the 
Sri Lankan Navy, forming the Nandimithra Class. It is not certain if these ships retain the 

Harpoon
 missile capability, however these ships retained their 

Gabriel missile
 capability.

Francesco Toldo (born 
December 2, 
1971 in 
Padua) is an 



Italian


 
football 
goalkeeper, who currently plays for 

Inter
. At his prime he was regarded as one of the best keepers in the world.



Club



Toldo came up with 

A.C. Milan
; however, he never played a game with the club. Instead, the Italian giants loaned him out to 
Trento and 


Ravenna

 from 
1991 to 
1993. Toldo then joined 

Fiorentina
, and became the club's starter for eight seasons, winning the 

Coppa Italia
 twice, and playing a 




UEFA Champions League



 for the Viola. One year before Fiorentina faced bankruptcy, he transferred to 

F.C. Internazionale Milano
 in 
2001, where he was the number one until the summer of 2005, when 

Brazil
ian keeper  
Julio Cesar relegated Toldo to the bench after Toldo elected to sit out Inter's summer friendly match tour of England. He regained the position of first choice keeper in February 2006 following his signing of a contract extension and a slip in form by Cesar, not before rumours linked him both to 
Palermo, A.C. Milan, and Fiorentina. The extension will keep him under contract with Inter until 2009. 2 He did score a goal against Juventus in a serie A campaign in injury time to make it 1-1.




National team



As of the end of 
2004, Toldo has been 
capped 28 times for 

Italy
. Despite facing competition from high profile keepers such as 










Gianluca Pagliuca









, 










Angelo Peruzzi









, and 










Gianluigi Buffon









, Toldo was chosen to start in 
Euro 2000 as Buffon broke his hand in a friendly match against Norway just eight days before the tournament started. Toldo helped his country to finish runner up behind 

France
. During the semi-final against the home team of 

Netherlands
, Toldo saved one penalty during the match and two during the shootout. In the final however he failed to save a crucial shot by 







Sylvain Wiltord






 as the game was nearing to a close with Italy ahead by one. France won in extra time with a goal by 
David Trezeguet.


He was an unused reserve in Italy's 
Euro 96, 
1998 World Cup, 
2002 World Cup, and 
Euro 2004 squads.

For other mountains named Mitchell, see 
Mount Mitchell (disambiguation).

Mount Mitchell lies about 100 km west of 

Brisbane, Australia
 and immediately south of 
Cunningham's Gap. The peak to the south of the gap was named by 







Allan Cunningham






 in 1828 and today is part of the 

Main Range National Park
. The height of this twin peaked mountain is 1168 metres. 1


To the north of Cunningham's Gap is 

Mount Cordeaux
.


A graded trail winds its way up to the main summit which offers some great views. From the peak on a clear day the tallest buildings in Brisbane can be seen, as can the 


D'Aguilar Range

, 
Fassifern Valley and many other parts of the 



Scenic Rim


.

Western Canada rivers



Fort Nelson River in western Canada

The Fort Nelson River is located in north-eastern 

British Columbia
, 

Canada
.  It flows 517 km generally north-westward to the 

Liard River
, a tributary of the 

Mackenzie River
, which empties into the 
Arctic Ocean.  The river drains a watershed of 55,900 square kilometers and is formed by the confluence of the 
Fontas River flowing from the east, and the 
Sikanni Chief River flowing from the south.  These, along with the 
Sahtaneh and 



Muskwa


 Rivers constitute the major tributaries. The source of the Sekanni Chief, on the eastern slope of the 


Rocky Mountains

, is ultimately the source of the Fort Nelson River.  


The land through which the river flows is generally flat, a mixture of 
boreal forests and 
muskeg.  The area is rich in wildlife, and forestry and mining (especially oil and gas) are major industries.


The river has a rich history.  The 
Dene and 


Sekani

 
First Nations used it for food and trade.  The river itself is named for the town of 

Fort Nelson
, established in 
1805 by the 


North West Company

 as a 
fur trading post near the river's junction with the 



Muskwa River


.  With Fort Nelson's relocation to the west following the construction of the 

Alaska Highway
 in the 1940s, there are no longer any major communities along this river.

Abauj-Torna (

Slovak
: Abov-Tur a, 

German
: Abaujwar-Tornau, 

Latin
: comitatus Abaujvar-Tornensis) is the name of a historic administrative county (



comitatus


) of the 

Kingdom of Hungary
. Its capital was 
Ko ice (Hungarian: Kassa). Its territory is presently in eastern 

Slovakia
 and north-eastern 

Hungary
. 


Geography


Around 1910, Abauj-Torna county shared borders with the counties 
Gomor-Kishont (Gemer-Malohont), 

Szepes
 (Spi ), 
Saros ( ari ), 
Zemplen (Zemplin), and 

Borsod
. The rivers 
Hornad and 



Bodva


 flowed through the county. Its area was 3317 
km  around 1910.




History


The county Abauj-Torna was a combination of the counties 
Abauj (Abov) and 
Torna (Tur a). It existed in three periods in the 18th, 19th and 20th century: first from 1785 until 1790, again from 1848 until 1859, and finally from 1882 until the end of 

World War I
. 


In the aftermath of 

World War I
, the northern part of Abauj-Torna county became part of newly formed Czechoslovakia (as Abovskoturnianska  upa), as recognized by the concerned states in the 1920 









Treaty of Trianon








. It continued to exist as an administrative unit until 1922. The southern half stayed in 

Hungary
 as the county Abauj-Torna, with capital 
Szikszo.


Following the provisions of the controversial 









First Vienna Award








, most of the Czechoslovak part came under Hungarian control in November 1938. It was added to the county Abauj-Torna, with capital 
Ko ice. After 







World War II






, the Trianon border was restored, and the Hungarian county Abauj-Torna merged with the county 

Borsod
 and the Hungarian part of 
Zemplen to form the present 
Borsod-Abauj-Zemplen county. Since 1993, when 

Czechoslovakia
 was split, the northern part of Abauj-Torna is part of 

Slovakia
, 
Ko ice region.

Arden Heights is a name increasingly applied to the western part of 





Annadale




, a neighborhood located on the 
South Shore of 
Staten Island, New York, 
USA.  The name  Arden Heights  is found on most maps of New York City, including Hagstrom's.









Erastus Wiman





, a noted Staten Island real estate developer, coined the name  Arden Heights  in 1896; the neighborhood's name probably refers to the hill that currently looms above the Village Greens shopping center and housing development.  (The moniker does refer to the now-shuttered 









Fresh Kills Landfill








, at the western end of Arden Avenue.  The landfill did not exist until the mid-17th Century.)


Long noted for being the site of 
St. Michael's Home For Children, a 
Roman Catholic 
orphanage, Arden Heights underwent a serious transformation when the aforementioned Village Greens, New York City's first 
planned urban development (or PUD), opened there in 1971.  Ground was broken for the project by Mayor 
John V. Lindsay, who in the late 1960s proudly announced that travel time from the Greens to 






Lower Manhattan





 would average one hour 15 minutes -- just about the same when taking a bus in 2007.


The Greens feature clustered townhomes built around looped streets -- one way in, one way out.  Off the main thoroughfares of Arden Avenue and Arthur Kill Road, these streets -- Hampton Green, Forest Green, Dover Green and Carlyle Green -- provides a relatively traffic-free environment and ample parking, making Village Greens a unique place to live in an otherwise overdeveloped Staten Island.  (Some Greens feature detached homes, which naturally fetch a higher market price than the townhomes, which are often clustered eight apiece.) Architectural guidelines and exterior home inspections by the Village Greens Homeowners Association have helped the community maintain it's appearance.


Other  Greens  -- namely Rolling Hill Green -- were built on land intended for the Village Greens but, for reasons unknown (some conjecture that the developers ran out of cash and construction workers) were never built. These  Greens  have their own recreational facilities.


A shopping center was simultaneously developed to serve the residents of Village Greens, as well as a 

New York City public elementary school
; Village Greens also features a 16-acre common park, featuring expanses of green grass, trees and -- most astonishingly -- two Olympic-sized swimming pools; all maintained through Village Greens Homeowners Association's relatively low common charges.  Today, the project stands at the center of a community bearing its own identity, separate from that of Annadale.


A large percentage of the residents of the development   and the many single-family homes that have since been built around it   are 
Jewish and 

Italian
, giving Arden Heights more common ground with such 
Mid-Island neighborhoods as 











Willowbrook










 than with Annadale and other South Shore communities.


About a mile north of the  Greens  is the 





Aspen Knolls




 development, located off Arthur Kill Road, next to the 
St. John Neumann Church. Plans for this development began in the early 1990s and were originally meant for housing of 






Navy





 families. However, due to 
Base Realignment and Closure, the housing contract was terminated in November 1994 after the closure of the Staten Island Homeport in 
Stapleton. With the development already planned, the developer opted to market the one, two, and three bedroom homes to the public. Construction began in 1995 and was finished in early 2006. During this time period, people moved into the community as each house was finished being built. The complex includes playing fields and a community center.


In 1982 the Saint Michael's orphanage, situated off Arthur Kill Road, closed, with some of the land on which it stood being sold to developers (who have since built the Aspen Knolls development) and the remainder set aside for use as a church, named for the recently-canonized St. John Neumann.  The church also maintains a 
convent for the 






Presentation Sisters





 on the east side of the property; in 2005 a section of this land was sold off, with new home construction to follow here too   still another sign of the continuing housing boom on Staten Island, which has gone on virtually uninterrupted since the 

Verrazano-Narrows Bridge
 opened in 1964.

Digimon Metal Empire family

Beast Spirit of Steel




Mercurymon is a 
fictional character from the 











Digimon










 
franchise, appearing as one of the villains of 
Digimon Frontier. He was voiced by 






Yasunori Matsumoto





 (Japan) and 

Daran Norris
 (US), the latter  who used a 
medieval accent.


Mercurymon - Description



Mercurymon (Japanese: Mercuremon) is the Legendary Warrior of Steel, using the power of 
AncientWisemon.


Mercurymon is quite arrogant and egotistic, believing himself to be superior to the other 
Legendary Warriors and constantly speaking in fancy language. He is also a crafty strategist, thinking of many strategies simultaneously. He has a fussy personality when it comes to precisely explaining methods of battle and such. He attacks his enemy's weak points but his behavior outside of calculations is brittle. One of his accomplishments was stealing 
Seraphimon's Fractal Code and using it himself to become 
ShadowSeraphimon. Mercurymon was defeated by 
Aldamon finally. He is the only warrior who lost their human spirit before their beast spirit, as well as the only one that never slide evolves.


A purified Mercurymon later appeared at the Village of Beginnings, to help the other legendary warriors fight 
Crusadermon and 
Dynasmon.



ShadowSeraphimon (Japanese: BlackSeraphimon) is a Mega Level Fallen Angel Digimon, the fusion of Mercurymon with Seraphimon's Data.


When 
Takuya as Agunimon entered the Light Sphere of Sakkakumon, he found 
Seraphimon's Fractal Code and Mercurymon's subconscious in the steel sphere. Mercurymon absorbed the Fractal Code and became ShadowSeraphimon, who immediately attacked Agunimon. No matter what Takuya did in his Agunimon or BurningGreymon forms, nothing worked. Instead ShadowSeraphimon beat him down with his hands, feet and his Testament attack. When the evil Angel used his Strike of the Seven Dark Stars attack it caused BurningGreymon to regress back to Takuya. Takuya then was about to be killed by ShadowSeraphimon when 
Tommy, 
Zoe, 
J.P., 
Bokomon and 
Neemon called out to Takuya, causing Seraphimon's Digi-Egg to glow. It floated up to the Light Sphere and sent a stream of light into Takuya, who Fusion Evolved to 
Aldamon. He easily defeated ShadowSeraphimon and scanned his Fractal Code, returning it to Seraphimon's Digi-Egg.



 It should be noted that while Mercurymon became ShadowSeraphimon to battle Takuya, it was only through the use of the real Seraphimon's fractal code, which means that it is not his true digivolution.






Mercurymon - Abilities





Mecurymon





ShadowSeraphimon






Attacks



Mercurymon''





 Dark Reflection (Generous Mirror): Uses his Irony Shield mirrors to absorb enemy projectile attacks and return the attack back at them.


 Offset Reflector (Japanese version only): Only used in episode 13 in the Japanese version, similar to Generous Mirror, except Mercurymon absorbs the attack in one mirror and emits it from the other.






ShadowSeraphimon''





 Strike of the Seven Dark Stars (Seven Hells): A darker version of Seraphimon's attack.


 Shadow Starburst (Testament): A close range electric shock.


 Shadow Shockwave: A sonic feedback strike.


 Shadow Blast: A beam that destroys anything in its path.









Sakkakumon - Description





Sakkakumon




Sakkakumon (Japanese: Sephirotmon) is the Legendary Beast Warrior of Steel, as well as the most powerful and the largest of the Beast Spirit Hybrids. His English name comes from sakkaku, the Japanese word for illusion, whilst his Japanese name comes from the 
Sephirot, the ten aspects of God in the Jewish religion.


When the Legendary Warriors were within Sakkakumon, he had different Digimon that represented each element in each Sphere. He had 
Volcamon for the Earth Sphere (below the center orb; below the head), 
Karatenmon for the Wind Sphere (bottom left of the center orb when facing Sakkakumon), 
Asuramon for the Fire Sphere (top left below the head when facing Sakkakumon), 
Parrotmon in the Thunder Sphere (right of center orb when facing Sakkakumon), 
Cherrymon in the Wood Sphere (bottom orb), and 
IceLeomon in the Ice Sphere (left of center orb when facing Sakkakumon). These six Digimon seemed like Digimon that had lost their Fractal Code to Mercurymon as they dissolved much differently from the others leaving no remains behind. 
Ranamon seemed to bring herself and her 
Honeybeemon groupies into the Water Sphere (bottom right of center orb when facing Sakkakumon) while 






Duskmon





 entered the Darkness Sphere (center orb; has marking similar to crest of light). Mercurymon's subconscious was in the Steel Sphere (which is Sakkakumon's head) and 
Seraphimon's data was in the Light Sphere (top right below the head when facing Sakkakumon).


Later, it took a combined attack by 
Aldamon, 
Kazemon, 
Beetlemon, and 
Kumamon to defeat him, as he had copied the data for all of their attacks by observing them while they were within the Spheres. He used this data to reflect the attacks on the users, but was unable to reflect combination attacks. Both of his spirits were transferred to 
Takuya's D-Tector. Mercurymon's spirits were later transferred into 
Koji's D-Tector so he could Hyper Spirit Evolve to 
MagnaGarurumon.




Sakkakumon - Abilities



Attacks





 Rumble Blend #1-10: When attacked with an elemental attack, he rearranges his body to fire the attack right back at the opponent. This is not referred to by name in the anime.







Trivia





The orchestra music heard during the scenes with ShadowSeraphimon in the Japanese version is  Requiem , the exact same piece heard in the Japanese versions of Movies 2 and 4 during the creations of Omnimon (Omegamon) and Imperialdramon Paladin Mode, respectively.







Sakkakumon/Sephirotmon's design greatly resembles the Kabbalistic angelic hierarchy of the Sephirot, with all the spheres matching the diagram, though the Da'at sphere in the upper center is missing.

Vladimir Nabokov





The Original of Laura

Unfinished at time of Nabokov's death



English





The Original of Laura is a 
novel that 




Vladimir Nabokov



 was writing at the time of his death in 1977.  It has never been published and its contents have been viewed only by Nabokov's son, wife, and a few scholars.  Nabokov had requested that upon his death the work be destroyed.  His family debated for over 30 years whether to carry out this wish to destroy an incomplete but perhaps important literary work.  In April 2008, Nabokov's son 












Dmitri Nabokov











 announced plans to publish the work1.


 Background 


According to his diaries, Nabokov first noted his work on the project on 
December 1, 
1974 under the title Dying Is Fun.  By the summer of 1976, he noted that the story was completed in his mind, but by then his health was failing rapidly.


When Nabokov died on 
July 2, 
1977, he was still working on the novel, since retitled The Opposite of Laura and finally The Original of Laura.  The incomplete manuscript consists of Nabokov's own handwriting across about 125 index cards 2, the equivalent of about 30 manuscript pages.3  (The use of index cards was normal for Nabokov, also used for many of his works, such as 





Lolita




 and 






Pale Fire





.4)




 Executor's dilemma 


Nabokov was a perfectionist and made it clear that, upon his death, any unfinished work was to be destroyed.  Nabokov's son 












Dmitri Nabokov











 and wife 


Vera Nabokov

 became his 
literary executors but could not bring themselves to destroy Nabokov's final work, and so it was placed in a 
Swiss Bank vault where it has remained since his death.  In 1991 Vera died, leaving Dmitri as the sole literary executor.5  Dmitri has wavered on whether to destroy the manuscript.  On the one hand, he is said to feel bound to uphold his  filial duty  and grant his father's request, but he has also said the novel  would have been a brilliant, original, and potentially totally radical book, in the literary sense very different from the rest of his oeuvre. 4


Scholars and enthusiasts have disagreed over whether the manuscript should be made public, as 

The Times
 posed the question:  the demands of the literary world versus the posthumous rights of an author over his art. 6  Dmitri has remarked cryptically that one other person possesses a key to the manuscript, but has not said who that person is.4  Like Dmitri, many observers are on the fence about the fate of the manuscript.  The author 









Edmund White








 has compared the request to 



Virgil


's request to destroy the 

Aeneid
 (ignored by 
Augustus Caesar) or 


Franz Kafka

's request to destroy his papers (ignored by his executor 
















Max Brod















).6 Nabokov himself weighed in on 


Nikolai Gogol

's decision to burn the sequels to the magnificent novel 
Dead Souls.


The journalist 










Ron Rosenbaum









, who corresponds with Dmitri, has said that in recent years Dmitri has been inclined toward destroying the manuscript, swayed by criticism of Nabokov such as allegations of plagiarism that arose from the discovery of 





a 1916 German short story,  Lolita 




 with some similarities to Nabokov's work, or critics who have interpreted Nabokov's work as suggesting that Nabokov himself was sexually abused.4  In April 2008 Dmitri told many publications including Nabokov Online Journal and 

Der Spiegel
 that he intends to publish the manuscript after all.7 In the Nabokov Online Journal interview with Suellen Stringer-Hye, Dmitri also stated that he had never seriously considered burning the manuscript. 8




 Content 





Laura, painted 1506 by 

Giorgione







Flora, painted 1515 by 


Titian





Several short excerpts of the work have been made public, most recently by German weekly DIE ZEIT, which in its 14 August issue reproduces some of Nabokov's original index cards that had been obtained by ZEIT reporter Malte Herwig. In the accompanying article, Herwig concludes that  Laura , although fragmentary, is  vintage Nabokov .9


In the late 1990s Dmitri read a portion of the book to a group of about 20 scholars at a centenary celebration of Vladimir Nabokov at 

Cornell University
.  The scholars 







Brian Boyd






 and 
Lara Delage-Toriel claim to have read the manuscript.  In 1999 two passages from The Original of Laura were published in The Nabokovian, a scholarly publication devoted to Nabokov.10  Zoran Kuzmanovich, a scholar of Nabokov, said of passages he heard at Cornell University:  It sounds as though the story is about aging but holding onto the original love of one's life. 5


According to a 2006 account of the book by Lara Delage-Toriel, the narrator and protagonist of Nabokov's book receives a novel titled My Laura from a painter.  The narrator realizes that the novel is in fact about his own wife Flora, whom the painter had once pursued.  In this novel within the novel, Laura is  destroyed  by the narrator (the  I  of the book).  Delage-Toriel also notes that the names of Laura and Flora, possibly refer to well-known 
High Renaissance portraits of women by 


Titian

 and 

Giorgione
, both evoking the Italian sonneteer 

Petrarch
's unconsummated obsession with a woman named Laura.


According to Delage-Toriel, the meaning of  the Original  is unclear:
Does it refer to the mistress of the  I,  the Laura of My Laura, or to the probable mistress of this novel s author, the Flora of The Original of Laura? The manuscript s playful juxtapositions obviously incite the reader to fuse both  originals  into a single original, a gesture which Nabokov graphically performs in  chapter  5, by contriving an amusing hybrid,  Flaura . On close observation of the manuscript, one notices that the name contains in fact two capital letters,  F  and  L , as though Nabokov had been loath to give precedence to either name and had instead opted for some typographical monster, a bicephalous cipher of sorts.11


A writer in 

The Times
 attributed a widely differing plot description to discussions with unidentified scholars:10
Philip Wild, an enormously corpulent scholar, is married to a slender, flighty and wildly promiscuous woman called Flora. Flora initially appealed to Wild because of another woman that he d been in love with, Aurora Lee. Death and what lies beyond it, a theme which fascinated Nabokov from a very young age, are central. The book opens at a party and there follow four continuous scenes, after which the novel becomes more fragmented. It is not clear how old Wild is, but he is preoccupied with his own death and sets about obliterating himself from the toes upwards through meditation. A sort of deliberate self-inflicted self-erasure.6

Military terminology





En cadre or cadre (pronounced  in the 











United Kingdom










, but sometimes / n kadre / in the 








United States







) is a 

French
 expression originally denoting either the complement of 
commissioned officers of a 
regiment or the permanent skeleton establishment of a unit, around which the unit could be built if needed. This latter usage was commonly used in countries which had 
conscription to denote the permanent staff of a unit who then trained the conscripts assigned to it.


In the 

United States military
, the word  cadre  is more often used to denote a group or member of a group of leaders, especially in units that conduct formal training schools. In 









United States Army








 jargon, the word is both singular and plural.


In the 

British Armed Forces
, the term is today usually used for a group of instructors, or for a unit that trains potential instructors or 
non-commissioned officers (in which case, it usually also includes the trainees themselves) e.g. the 

Royal Marines
 

Mountain Leader Training Cadre

The renal arteries normally arise off the side of the 
abdominal aorta, immediately below the 
superior mesenteric artery, and supply the 
kidneys with 
blood. Each is directed across the 
crus of the diaphragm, so as to form nearly a right angle with the aorta. 

The renal arteries carry a large portion of total blood flow to the kidneys. Up to a third of total cardiac output can pass through the renal arteries to be filtered by the kidneys.


The arterial supply of the kidneys is variable and there may be one or more renal arteries supplying each kidney. It is located above the renal vein.



Asymmetries before reaching kidney



Due to the position of the aorta, the 
inferior vena cava and the kidneys in the body, the right renal artery is normally longer than the left renal artery. 





 The right passes behind the 
inferior vena cava, the right 
renal vein, the 
head of the pancreas, and the descending part of the 
duodenum. 







 The left is somewhat higher than the right; it lies behind the left renal vein, the 
body of the pancreas and the 
lienal vein, and is crossed by the 
inferior mesenteric vein.






At kidney


Before reaching the 
hilus of the kidney, each artery divides into four or five branches; the greater number of these (anterior branches) lie between the renal vein and 
ureter, the vein being in front, the ureter behind, but one or more branches (posterior branches) are usually situated behind the ureter. 


Each vessel gives off some small 
inferior suprarenal branches to the 
suprarenal gland, the 
ureter, and the surrounding cellular tissue and muscles. 


One or two accessory renal arteries are frequently found, more especially on the left side they usually arise from the aorta, and may come off above or below the main artery, the former being the more common position. Instead of entering the kidney at the hilus, they usually pierce the upper or lower part of the gland.




Diseases of the renal arteries




Renal artery stenosis
, or narrowing of one or both renal arteries will lead to hypertension as the affected kidneys release 
renin to increase blood pressure to preserve perfusion to the kidneys.  RAS is diagnosed with an MRA (magnet-resonance scan) of abdomen.  It is treated with the use of balloon angioplasty and stents, if necessary.



Atherosclerosis can also affect the renal arteries and can lead to poor perfusion of the kidneys leading to reduced kidney function and, possibly, 
renal failure.

Motto:




USS H-9 (SS-152) was an H class submarine that was on active duty with the 
U.S. Navy from 
1918 to 
1922.

The 
Imperial Russian Navy ordered 18 



H-class submarines


 from the 
Electric Boat Company in 1915. Eleven were delivered, and served as the 
American Holland class submarines, but shipment of the final six was held up pending the outcome of the 
Russian Revolution of 1917, and the boats were stored in knockdown condition at 
Vancouver, British Columbia. All six were purchased by the 






United States Navy





 on 
20 May 
1918 and assembled at 
Puget Sound Navy Yard.


H-9 (SS-152) was 
launched on 
23 November 
1918 and 
commissioned on 
25 November with Lieutenant Clarke Withers in command.


Joining SubDiv 6 at 
San Pedro, California, and later being transferred to SubDiv 7 there, H-9 participated in a variety of battle and training exercises along the West Coast. She also patrolled off 
Santa Catalina Island, and put in at 


Mare Island

 for periodic overhauls.



US H-9 submerging.





H-9 sailed from San Pedro on 
25 July 
1922 and arrived in 

Norfolk, Virginia
, on 
14 September, with SubDivs 6 and 7. The submarine decommissioned at Norfolk on 
3 November 
1922. Her name was struck from the 
Naval Vessel Register on 
26 February 
1931. She was sold for scrapping 
28 November 
1933.

Banks of the United States




The Bank of Italy was founded in 

San Francisco, California
, 
USA, in 1904 by 
Amadeo Giannini.  It grew by a branch banking strategy to become the 

Bank of America
, the world's largest commercial bank with 493 branches in California and assets of $5 billion in 1945.

The bank was established to serve working class citizens of the area, especially Italians living in San Francisco s North Beach neighborhood.  The bank survived the 
San Francisco earthquake and fire of 1906 and was one of the first to offer loans to businesses to help rebuild the city.


The 







Bank of Italy Building






, which later became a 



National Historic Landmark


, was opened in 1908.  Giannini had his office space in an open area on the first floor.1  In 1909 the bank began opening branches in other cities and had 24 branches by 1918, at which time it was the first state-wide branch banking system.


The bank was renamed 

Bank of America
 in the 1920's.1  As Chairman of the new Bank of America, Giannini expanded the bank throughout his tenure, which ended with his death in 1949.


Amadeo Giannini and the  Bank of Italy  were also the basis for the classic 1932 Frank Capra movie 

American Madness
 which was an original screenplay titled Faith by Robert Riskin.

This article is about the North American food distributor. For other companies with the same or similar name, see 
ShopRite.



ShopRite Supermarkets is a 
retailers' cooperative (co-op) chain of 
supermarkets in the 


Northeastern

 








United States







, in the states of 

New Jersey
, 





New York




, 

Connecticut
, 

Delaware
, and 





Pennsylvania




. Based in 

Elizabeth, New Jersey
, ShopRite consists of 43 individually owned and operated affiliates with over 200 stores, all under its corporate and distribution arm, 





Wakefern Food Corporation




.


In recent years ShopRite has renovated, expanded or totally rebuilt many of its older stores, as well as adding new ones.  Most stores are larger than before with improved facilities. Some of the older ShopRite stores date back to the 1950s and 1960s. Examples of a newly built giant ShopRite can be found in 

Wharton
, 

New Jersey
, opened in 2001, and a rebuilt one in nearby 

Succasunna
.
ShopRite's slogan  This is Your Neighborhood...This is Your ShopRite  is used when promoting and supporting community events, which is used on their current manufactured trucks. ShopRite is also known for its yearly Can Can Sale, held every January since 1971, and in July 2002 introduced the Summer Can Can Sale.


In the early 1990s, ShopRite introduced the 
Price Plus Club Card, which replaced the Courtesy Card. The customer registers free of charge to become a member of the club. The customer gives the cashier the card every time the check out and it adds up to various promotions such as Baby Bucks or 

Continental Airlines
 One Pass Miles. The Price Plus card may also save the customer money on items they purchase, depending if they are on sale or not.  The benefit of the Price Plus card to ShopRite is that it allows the cooperative to track every purchase and break down consumer purchasing habits based on a variety of variables, even what time of day the consumer prefers to shop.


Since 1999, ShopRite offers the same merchandise on its website, under the service name ShopRite from Home, through MyWebGrocer.com.



History





ShopRite logo (1974 to 2001)



The chain got its start in 1946, when a 










Del Monte Foods









 sales representative talked to several independent 
grocers in 

Newark
, 

New Jersey
 who were having problems getting the best prices for wholesale goods. He suggested they try 
cooperative buying, and they did.


Seven of them eventually went in, and all agreed the experiment was a success. With a $1,000 initial investment from each, Wakefern Foods was incorporated on 
December 5, 
1946.


The ShopRite name was coined in 1951 as a competitive advantage. It not only worked to draw in shoppers; it attracted new members to the cooperative, which grew to 50 members within a year.


In 1958, ShopRite decided to cut prices across the board 10% as an alternative to giving away 
trading stamps as many other supermarkets in New Jersey were doing. The move was again successful and drew in more customers and members. By 1961, Wakefern had 70 members, was doing $100 million in annual sales and not only had become a major player in New Jersey, it was attracting members from neighboring states.


Things slowed down a little later on that decade when one large member, Supermarkets General, pulled out, halving the chain's size. Its stores became 

Pathmark
 in 1968.  The remaining members redoubled their efforts, adopted  one member, one vote  as a management principle, and expanded aggressively. By the late 1970s, the volume lost from Supermarkets General's departure had been restored.


Today, it is the largest retailer-owned cooperative in the United States.  An interesting result of the cooperative system is that there has been no set format for building architecture, store layout or color scheme of the storefronts.  Most stores are the product of the era in which they were opened as well as the whim of the owner.  For example, the ShopRite of 

West Caldwell, New Jersey
 has a Japanese motif inside and outside of the store (including rickshaws and a sign that says  Sayonara  at the exit). Even some stores owned by the same person look different. For example, the Ronetco family of stores (Netcong, Byram, Newton, Franklin, Flanders, Mansfield, and Succasunna) all look different from one another on the outside (including the shopping carts and Cart Corrals), although inside they have the same general layout. Several Shop Rite stores that have opened up in stores that were once previous stores usually contain elements of the previous occupant. On the other hand, as large corporations buy up stores, recent years have brought a homogenization in building design and store layout.

In 2004, with the construction of a massive Home Depot directly adjacent to the small store, a decision was made to close the store and Foodarama moved its garden center operations into a 55,000. sq. ft.former 

Frank's Nursery   Crafts
 store.  The store had operated as a Franks location for only 4 years before the company was liquidated, and the large building combined 23,000 sq ft (2,100 m2). of interior selling space with 32,000 sq ft (3,000 m2). of covered outside selling area, for a total of 55,000 sq ft (5,100 m2).1  The ShopRite Garden Center closed in 2008.





ShopRite Wines   Spirits

 Wakefern members also operate a cooperative chain of stores which offer wine, beer and spirits called ShopRite Wines   Spirits.  Most of the stores are located adjacent-to, or inside-of ShopRite Supermarkets; however, there are several freestanding stores.  One of the stores (in Pennington, NJ) even offers a bar right inside the ShopRite store.
Members operate 36 ShopRite Wine and Spirits Shops in 

New Jersey
 and 





New York




.


Sunrise ShopRites of West Caldwell also operates 3 (Parsippany, NJ, West Caldwell, NJ and Westfield, NJ) ShopRite Sunrise Wine-Cellar locations which offer an expanded selection of high-quality and specialty wines. These stores are generally smaller than their normal Shoprite counterparts, and always specialize in specifically wines and related alcoholic beverages.





ShopRiteFlowers.com


In December 2006, Wakefern partnered with vistaflor.com to launch Shopriteflowers.com. Vistaflor is a Colombian flower grower and provides direct home delivery of floral arrangements under ShopRiteFlowers.com brand and does the same for Costco.

Longford




Longford is a 
village immediately west of 
Heathrow Airport in the 



London Borough of Hillingdon


. Longford is 15.8 miles (25.4 km) west of 

Charing Cross
. 

The village is located on the Bath Road, to south of the 





M4




 and just north of the Heathrow Western Perimeter Road. The area is characterised by a historic village core. Despite its close proximity to the 





A4




, the Stanwell Moor Road and Heathrow Airport, Longford has retained its village character.


The village developed on the site of the (long) ford on the 





River Colne




, which was an important crossing point for travellers on the Old Bath Road. The name Longford derives from the 2 words  long  and  ford  extending from the first bridge at Harmondsworth almost to 

Colnbrook
. 


Limited evidence survives of Roman occupation though archaeological excavations have revealed 2 brooches of Roman date. It is believed that Longford developed as a small Saxon settlement dating from the 5th to 7th century AD. Historic buildings still survive from the medieval and post medieval period.

Guiseley railway station is 
railway station in 

Guiseley
, in the 

City of Leeds
 
metropolitan borough, 

West Yorkshire
, 

England
.  On the 
Wharfedale Line between 

Ilkley
 and 
Leeds City station/
Bradford Forster Square, it is served by 

Class 333
 electric trains run by 

Northern Rail
, which also manages the station.


Services


During Monday to Saturday daytimes services run to/from Leeds and 

Bradford
 twice per hour, meaning that as Guiseley is the first station that is served by trains on both branches of the line, there are four services every hour to Ilkley.  During Monday to Saturday evenings, services are hourly to/from both Leeds and Bradford Forster Square.  On Sundays, services are hourly to/from Leeds and every two hours to/from Bradford.


The station facilities were redeveloped in 2002 to give a new waiting room on platform two (for trains to Leeds and Bradford) and a waiting room and ticket office on platform one (for trains to Ilkley).  This office is open from 0615-1930 Mon-Sat and 0915-1630 on Sundays.  A small car park, which gets rather full on weekdays, is accessible from Station Road.  Passengers on foot can also access the station via a path from Netherfield Road or a path that connects with Morton Terrace and Otley Road.


Along with 

Horsforth
 station on the 
Harrogate line, Guiseley is one of the two closest railway stations to 

Leeds Bradford International Airport
, at nearby 

Yeadon
.  An hourly 
bus service (Monday to Saturday daytimes, service 737) between the airport and 

Bradford Interchange
 runs along nearby Oxford Road.  However, a more frequent bus service to/from the airport runs from 

Leeds railway station
 but this, in the long run, could take longer.

Cocaine







The 
coca plant, Erythroxylon coca.




On a New Organic Base in the Coca Leaves is an 
1860 
dissertation written by Dr. 

Albert Niemann
. Its title in German is Uber eine neue organische Base in den Cocablattern. The piece describes, in detail, how Niemann isolated 
cocaine, a 
crystalline 
alkaloid.  It also earned Niemann his 


Ph.D.

 and is now in the 

British Library
.  He wrote of the alkaloid's  colourless transparent prisms  and said that,  Its solutions have an alkaline reaction, a bitter taste, promote the flow of saliva and leave a peculiar numbness, followed by a sense of cold when applied to the tongue.  Niemann named the alkaloid  cocaine    as with other alkaloids its name carried the  -ine  
suffix.

Ancient Roman festivals




In the Roman calendar, March was sacred to Mars. The  jumping priests,  or 
Salii began the Festival of the Salii on 
March 21 with a purification of the sacred trumpets that the Romans carried off to war. That date was originally the new year because it was the start of the growing and campaign season.

On 
March 21, the Salii marched to the 
Regia taking the bronze 
Ancilia, the sacred shield that had fallen down from heaven, and its 11 copies. They danced through the streets carrying poles with the shields mounted on them in their left hands. With their other hand, they banged the shields with a drumstick. Even in the time of 
Cicero, the 
Carmen Saliare they sang was so ancient that he could not understand it. 


At the end of each night, they would stop at a place to be feasted before starting up again the next day. 


This festival would end on 
March 24 when they would return to the Regia and return the shields.

.  As of 2001, the population was 71,439.



 Government 


Marie Ferreira of the 

DA
 became executive mayor after the March 2006 local government elections when the DA formed a coalition with 
ICOSA since no single party had obtained an outright majority. The DA held 10 seats in the 23-seat council followed by 8 for the 

ANC
 and 3 for ICOSA. Following the September 2007 floor-crossing window the DA gained an outright majority when 3 councillors defected to the DA resulting in the DA holding 13 seats out of 23 while the ANC lost a seat to the DA and currently has 7. ICOSA lost it's representation in the council when 2 councillors defected to the DA and it's one ward councillor became an independent.

Law enforcement in Canada




A police board is an appointed form of 
local government charged with the responsibility of overseeing a territorial 
police department in 

Canada
 - the term is also used for the same function in 

Scotland
.  Every municipality in Canada that operates their own police force is required to establish such a board.  The legislation of Police Boards is in the jurisdiction of each provincial legislature.

All 
municipalities with a population over 5,000 are required by the British Columbia Police Act to provide for a police service.  Municipalities in this category have two options: contract with the 
provincial 
government for the 


Royal Canadian Mounted Police

 or create an independent 
police department.  


Municipalities that choose to operate an independent 
police force are required to create a 
civilian oversight body called a  Police Board .  Members of the police board are 
civilian members of the 
community and are appointed by the provincial government through an 
order in council sponsored by the 
Solicitor-General (of B.C.).  A police board usually has between five and seven members, depending on the size of the municipality.  The 
Mayor of the municipality is, by law, automatically the 
Chairperson of the board.  One other member of board is usually nominated by the municipality to represent the municipality's interest.  Board members are selected from a variety of backgrounds and are usually appointed for one or two year terms.  They may be re-appointed to a maximum of six years service. Except for the Mayor, municipal 
councillors may not be appointed to the municipality's police board.  


The mandate of a police board is to own and operate the independent municipal police department ensuring that police independence from political interference is maintained.  The board functions as:





 the employer of both the  sworn  police officers and the civilian employees of the department and sets the priorities and develops the administrative policies of the department;


 the financial overseer and develops the annual police operating 
budget in consultation with the municipal council; and


 the supervisor of the 










Chief Constable









.




The board selects and evaluates the Chief Constable and sometimes other senior departmental managers thereby allowing the board to maintain indirect control and influence over the department, although, in the same way that the police board is independent of the municipal council for policing matters, the Chief Constable is independent from the board for operational matters.


Public complaints against the police were formerly dealt with by the police board.  Since July 1, 1998, public complaints are handled by the 
British Columbia Police Complaint Commissioner who, as an 
Officer of the Legislature, is appointed by and responsible to the 
legislative assembly.  Only level of service complaints and complaints against the Chief Constable are still dealt with by the police board.


Police departments may be amalgamated at the discretion of the Solicitor-General.  This occurred on January 1, 2003 when 
Esquimalt and 

Victoria
 police departments were amalgamated and a combined police board created with the Mayor of Victoria as the Chairperson and the Mayor of Esquimalt as the 
Vice-Chairperson.  Enhanced  professional response, crime prevention and investigation in both communities  were cited as the reasons for the amalgamation.


The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) are contracted to provide municipal policing to 59 British Columbia municipalities including 

Surrey
, 

Burnaby
, 

Kelowna
, 

Prince George
, 

Kamloops
 and 

Nanaimo
.  Police boards are not utilized for RCMP municipalities.

Dermorphin is a hepta-
peptide first isolated from the skin of South American 
frogs belonging to the family 
Phyllomedusa.1 The peptide is a natural 
opiate that binds as an 
agonist with high potency and selectivity to 
mu Opioid receptors.23 Dermorphin is about 30-40 times more potent than 
morphine but less likely to produce 
drug tolerance and 
addiction.4

Dermorphin is not found in humans or other mammals and similar D-
amino acid peptides have only been found in 
bacteria, 
amphibians and 
molluscs.5 Dermorphin appears to be made in these through an unusual 
posttranslational modification carried out by an amino acid isomerase.6 The reason for this unusual process is that the D-alanine in this peptide is not among the 20 in the 
genetic code and cannot be encoded by the 
genes by higher organisms.





Structure of dermorphin: H-Tyr-D-Ala-Phe-Gly-Tyr-Pro-Ser-NH2


Chemical formula: C40H50N8O10


Molecular weight: 802.9 g/mol

Blackletter




The 

German
 word Schwabacher (pronounced ) refers to a specific 
blackletter 
typeface. The term derives from the village of 

Schwabach
.


Characteristics





overview on some blackletter typefaces



The small-letter g and the capital-letter H have particularly distinctive forms.




History


The Schwabacher was a blackletter typeface that evolved from 
textualis under the influence of Humanist type design in Italy. It was nearer to handwriting than the textualis style. In the 16th century, it was displaced by 
fraktur as the most-used 

German
 typeface. It was still used occasionally until the mid 20th century. 


Fraktur was abandoned, although widely-used before, by the 
Nazis with the Schrifterlass of 
3 January 
1941, where it is called Schwabacher Judenlettern  Jew-letters of Schwabach .1 There is however no evidence of any actual connection between Jews and the Schwabacher typeface.




Samples





Schwabacher





(The German sentence in the figures reads:  Beispiel Alte Schwabacher [Example of old Schwabacher]: Victor jagt zwolf Boxkampfer quer uber den Sylter Deich . This is a nonsense sentence meaning  Victor chases twelve box fighters across the dike of 


Sylt

 , but contains all 26 letters of the alphabet plus the German 






umlauts





 and is thus an example of a 
pangram.)

The Dark Knight (film)
.
Dark Night of the Soul (

Spanish
: La noche oscura del alma) is a treatise written by Spanish 
poet and 
Roman Catholic 
mystic 
Saint John of the Cross. It has become an expression used to describe a phase in a person's 
spiritual life, a 
metaphor for a certain loneliness and desolation. It is referenced by spiritual traditions throughout the world.


History and description


The phrase  dark night of the soul  emerged from the writings of 
Saint John of the Cross, a 






Carmelite





 priest in the 

16th century
.  Dark Night of the Soul, the name of a poem and its theological commentary, are among the Carmelite priest's most well-known writings. The texts tell of the saint's mystical development and the stages he is subjected to on his journey towards union with God.


The Dark Night of the Soul is divided into two books that reflect the two phases of the dark night. The first is a purification of the senses. The second and more intense of the two stages is that of the spirit, which is the less common of the two. Dark Night of the Soul further describes the ten steps on the ladder of mystical love, previously described by 
Saint Thomas Aquinas and in part by 


Aristotle

, referred to by medieval Catholic theologians as the Philosopher, for he established justification for the existence of one true God and thus refuted his master, 


Plato

. The text was written while John of the Cross was imprisoned by his Carmelite brothers, who opposed his reformations to the Order.


Saint 
Therese of Lisieux, a 19th-century French 
Carmelite, underwent similar experience. Centering on doubts about the afterlife, she reportedly told her fellow nuns,  If you only knew what darkness I am plunged into.  1


While this crisis is assured to be temporary in nature, it may be extended. The  dark night  of Saint 

Paul of the Cross
 in the 18th century lasted 45 years, from which he ultimately recovered. 


Mother Teresa

 of Calcutta, according to letters released in 2007,  may be the most extensive such case on record , lasting from 1948 almost up until her death in 1997, with only brief interludes of relief between 2. Franciscan Friar 
Father Benedict Groeschel, a friend of Mother Teresa for a large part of her life, claims that  the darkness left  towards the end of her life 3. 


The  dark night  might clinically or secularly be described as the letting go of one's 
ego as it holds back the 


psyche

, thus making room for some form of transformation, perhaps in one's way of defining oneself or one's relationship to 
God.  This interim period can be frightening, hence the perceived  darkness.  


In the 
Christian tradition, one who has developed a strong 
prayer life and consistent devotion to 
God suddenly finds traditional prayer extremely difficult and unrewarding for an extended period of time during this  dark night.   The individual may feel as though God has suddenly abandoned them or that his or her prayer life has collapsed.  In the most pronounced cases, belief is lost in the very existence of God and/or validity of religion, rendering the individual an atheist, even if they bravely continue with the outward expressions of faith. 


Rather than resulting in devastation, however, the dark night is perceived by mystics and others to be a blessing in disguise, whereby the individual is stripped (in the dark night of the senses) of the spiritual ecstacy associated with acts of virtue.  Although the individual may for a time seem to outwardly decline in their practices of virtue, they in reality become more virtuous, as they are being virtuous less for the spiritual rewards (ecstasies in the cases of the first night) obtained and more out of a true love for God.  It is this purgatory, a purgation of the soul, that brings purity and union with God.




In popular culture



Author and humorist 


Douglas Adams

 satirized the phrase in the title of his 1988 Science Fiction novel, 





The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul




.


It is also been used as a song title by several bands and music artists, including 

Steve Bell
, 


Loreena McKennitt

, 


The Get Up Kids

, 


Mayhem

 and by CHH artist shai linne in the Solus Christus project.


Bill Murray's character in the movie Groundhog Day makes a reference to  Dark Night of the Soul .

The Manhattan Project was an 








American







 
film released on 
June 13, 
1986.1 Named after the 











World War II-era program










, the plot revolves around a gifted high school student who decides to construct a nuclear bomb for a national science fair. The film's underlying theme involves the 
Cold War of the 1980s when government secrecy and 
mutually assured destruction were key political and military issues. Costing $500,000 to produce, the film grossed $3,900,000 
USD at the 
box office.2  It was directed by 

Marshall Brickman
, based upon his screenplay co-written with Thomas Baum, and starred 

Christopher Collet
, 

John Lithgow
, 


John Mahoney

, and 

Cynthia Nixon
.


The plot



Dr. John Mathewson (

John Lithgow
) discovers a new process for refining 
plutonium to purities greater than 99.99 percent. The U.S. government provides him a laboratory located near a suburban neighborhood in 

Ithaca, New York
 masked as the medical company, Medatomics. Mathewson moves to Ithaca and meets real estate agent Elizabeth Stephens (

Jill Eikenberry
) while searching for an apartment. A single mom, he attempts to win her affections by inviting her teenage son Paul (

Christopher Collet
) to take a tour of Medatomics and see  one of the sexiest lasers in the free world. 


Mathewson is confident in the lab's cover story but Paul, an unusually gifted student with a passion for science, becomes suspicious when he discovers a statistically impossible patch of five-leaf clover on the grounds. Paul and his aspiring journalist girlfriend, Jenny Anderman (

Cynthia Nixon
), decide to expose the weapons factory in dramatic fashion. Paul breaks into Medatomics and steals a container of plutonium. To obtain maximum publicity, Paul decides to build a nuclear bomb and enter the product into the New York Science Fair. After convincing his mother and his school that his project is about hamsters bred in darkness, he begins research and construction of the nuclear device. 


Mathewson and Medatomics discover that a container of plutonium has been replaced by a bottle of shampoo. A military investigation team, led by Lt. Colonel Conroy (


John Mahoney

), immediately arrives on the scene. Their investigation reveals that Paul is responsible for stealing the plutonium. Suspecting him of terrorism, the investigators invade Paul's home and discover he and Jenny have left for the science fair.


The agents capture the couple in New York City and Mathewson, who feels personally responsible for the crisis, has a private talk with Paul. He tells Paul to just give the bomb to the agents or 
 they'll lock you in a room somewhere and throw away the room.  Several of Paul's friends at the science fair help him and Jenny escape custody and they become fugitives from the government.


In an effort to expose the company, Paul hatches a brave plan to return the bomb on his own terms. Ensuring Jenny is a safe distance away, he calls the agents from a pay phone and walks into Medatomics with the nuclear bomb surrounded by snipers and agents. During the standoff, negotiations stall and Paul suddenly arms the nuclear bomb. Mathewson, convinced that Paul is not an actual terrorist, attempts to intercede on his behalf. 


Due to radiation from the pure plutonium, the bomb's timer suddenly turns on by itself and begins to count down with increasing speed. All sides put down their weapons and frantically work as a team to dismantle the nuclear device. They manage to disarm the bomb at the last possible moment (the timer reads 7:16:45, a sly reference to the first nuclear test on 
July 16, 
1945).3 After a brief moment of relief, Conroy decides to arrest Paul. Mathewson refuses to cooperate and opens the door to the company revealing a large crowd, including Jenny and the press. He says to the military,  We blew it.  With the weapons factory exposed, Conroy and his agents leave the premises and the residents of Ithaca embrace Paul as a hero.




Analysis


This movie is a 
cautionary tale regarding the dangers of nuclear weapon capability, a common theme of films dating back to 







Stanley Kubrick's






  (1964).4 The theme was especially prominent in the early 1980s with the debut of the television film 

The Day After
 and the motion pictures 

Testament
 and 

WarGames
.5 This movie is often compared to WarGames, with the similarity of a lone teenager almost causing an international nuclear crisis.


The plot is said to have been influenced by the case of 









John Aristotle Phillips








, a Princeton University undergraduate who in 1977 came to prominence as the  A-Bomb Kid  for designing a nuclear weapon in a term paper using publicly-available books and articles.6




Production


The Manhattan Project was filmed in and around 

Rockland County, New York
. Locations included Suffern High School, King's Daughters Library in Haverstraw and the Orchards of Conklin in Pomona.78 The producers held an actual science fair at the 




New York Penta Hotel



 in which participants received $75, and utilized the set for filming. The film's director and screenplay co-writer 

Marshall Brickman
 had established his career as a co-writer on several 


Woody Allen

 films including 

Annie Hall
 (1977) and 

Manhattan
 (1979), winning an 

Academy Award
 for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen for Annie Hall. The Manhattan Project would be his third film as director, following the comedies Simon (1980) and 

Lovesick
 (1983).9 Brickman received the President's Award from the 
Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy   Horror Films for The Manhattan Project. Brickman would not direct again until the 2001 
Showtime television movie Sister Mary Explains It All. In the role of Jenny, 

Cynthia Nixon
 was nominated for the 



Young Artist Award


 in the category of Exceptional Performance by a Young Actress, Supporting Role.10




Technical Errors


Dr. Matthewson claims that the device would produce a  50-kiloton blast.  This is not nearly strong enough to do the kind of damage described. Some of the strategic nuclear weapons in the U.S. arsenal are capable of yields of up to 475 kilotons, and past warheads were capable of yields exceeding 3000 kilotons.  For comparison, the 

Little Boy
 atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima was only a 13- to 16-kiloton weapon.


Plant life is quite resilient to the effects of radiation.  To find a patch of five leaf clovers, which had presumably been mutated by radioisotopes released during reprocessing, would have been evidence of a catastrophic containment failure.  A radiation leak of that magnitude would have been lethal for workers within the facility as well as civilians within the local community.


Plutonium does not release radiation without undergoing fission.  The half-life of pu-239 is 24110 years. Therefore the timer on the device could not have been negatively affected by the release of radiation.




Trivia



When the agents arrive at Paul's mom's home, she is briefly seen reading a first edition hardback copy of  





The Fourth Protocol




  by 


Frederick Forsyth

, published two years before in August 1984, which vividly describes the potential danger of small kit-constructed nuclear weapons.

Angelica sinensis, commonly known as  dong quai  or  female 
ginseng  is a herb from the family 
Apiaceae, indigenous to 
China.



Medicinal uses



Chinese


Its drying root is commonly known in 

Chinese
 as Radix Angelicae Sinensis, or Chinese angelica (
traditional Chinese:   ; 
simplified Chinese: ; 
pinyin: d nggu ) and is widely used in 
Chinese traditional medicine to treat gynecological ailments, 
fatigue, mild anemia and 
high blood pressure. Chinese angelica possesses the distinction of being one of the few good non-animal sources of 
Vitamin B12, along with some varieties of 
yeast and 
microalgae like 
spirulina.23. It has 
analgesic, 
anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic and 
sedative effects. The plant's phytochemicals consist of 
coumarins, 
phytosterols, 
polysaccharides, 
ferulate, and 
flavonoids.


It is also used as an 
aphrodisiac.




Korean


A. sinensis is also used in 
traditional Korean medicine, where it is called danggwi (  ).




Prohibition


Being a uterine tonic and hormonal regulator this herb is an effective herb for female reproductive system. It is often used in premenstrual syndrome formulas as well as menopausal formulas. However, this herb is not recommended during pregnancy due to possible hormonal, anticoagulant, and anti-platelet properties. Animal research has noted conflicting effects on the uterus, with reports of both stimulation and relaxation. Dong quai is traditionally viewed as increasing the risk of 
miscarriage.4

Nelly Anna  Nel  Benschop (
January 16 
1918 - 
January 31 
2005) was a 

Dutch
 
poetess. She was the best selling poet in 
the Netherlands.


Benschop was born in 

The Hague
 and grew up in a strictly religious 
Dutch Reformed family. She followed the Mulo (advanced elementary education) and after that the 
kweekschool (teacher training college), graduating in 1937. She took 
recitation lessons from 
Lily van Haghe. During the 
Second World War, she also received diplomas for 





English




 and 

French
. 


After the war, she left her parents' house and became 
teacher at a girls' boarding school in 







Driebergen






. After that, she worked as a teacher of 
Dutch and French at a Mulo in 

Arnhem
 and a lyceum (grammar school) in 

Veenendaal
. She retired in 1981.


Benschop started writing poetry in 1948. In the meantime she recited poems of others, with sometimes a few of her own added. She debuted in 1967 by 
Kok Publishers in 
Kampen with the volume Gouddraad uit vlas ( Gold thread from flax ). The publisher almost didn't dare to bring it out, but the volume was an enormous success, and was reprinted sixty times. Of all her volumes of poetry, a total of three million copies were sold. Benschop also wrote 
aphorisms. Several of her poems are often quoted in death notices, especially In memoriam voor een vriend ( In memoriam for a friend ).


Her work is deeply 


Christian

, and because of that has not been taken very seriously by literary critics. Her work is considered more pastoral than literary. She said herself, with some self-mockery:  I write meditations in rhyme . Recurring themes in her work are suffering, death and Christian comfort.


She died, aged 87, in 

Arnhem
.

David HaLevi Segal (

Hebrew
:              ) (c. 1586 1667), also known as the Taz (   ) or the Turei Zahav, was a prominent 
Polish 
halakhic authority and author of a significant commentary on the 



Shulchan Aruch


. 


Biography


Born in 
Ludmir, 


Volhynia

, Segal was the son of Samuel HaLevi Segal. His chief 



Torah


 teacher was his older brother, Isaac. He became a reputed 
Talmudic scholar, and married the daughter of Rabbi 
Joel Sarkes of 

Brest
, whom he frequently quoted in his works.


After residing with his father-in-law and continuing his Torah studies for several years, Segal and his family moved to 
Cracow. He was then appointed chief rabbi of 
Potlitsha, near 








Rava







, where he lived in great poverty. Later he went to 
Posen, where he remained for several years.


Around 1641 he became Rav of the old community of 
Ostrog, or Ostroh, in Volhynia. There Segal established a famous 
yeshiva, and was soon recognized as one of the great halakhic authorities of his time. In Ostrog, Segal wrote a commentary on 
Joseph Caro's Shulchan Aruch (

Yoreh De'ah
), which he published in 

Lublin
 in 1646. This commentary, known as the Turei Zahav ( Rows of Gold ), was accepted as one of the highest authorities on Jewish law. Thereafter, Segal became known by the 
acronym of his work, the TaZ.


Two years after the publication of his commentary, Segal and his family had to flee the massacres of the 
Cossack insurrection under 
Bogdan Chmielnicki in 1648 1649. Segal went to 
Steinitz near 
Ostrau, 






Moravia





, where he remained for some time. Not happy in Moravia, he returned to Poland as soon as order was restored, settling in 
Lemberg, where he remained for the rest of his life.


In Lemberg, Segal was appointed 












Av Beit Din











 (head of the rabbinical court). When Rabbi 
Meir Sack, chief rabbi of Lemberg, died in 1653, he succeeded him in this position as well. 


Segal's last days were saddened by the death of his two sons, Mordechai and Solomon, who were killed in the riots occurring in Lemberg in the spring of 1664. His wife had died long before; now Segal married the widow of her brother, Samuel Hirz, Rav of 
Pi czow. His third son from his first marriage, Isaiah, and his stepson, Aryeh Lob, were the two Polish scholars who were sent   probably by Segal, or at least with his consent   to 
Turkey in 1666 to investigate the claims of the pseudo-
Messiah, 






Shabbetai Tzvi





. The two returned with a present for Segal from Shabbetai Tzvi   a white silk robe, along with a letter in which the latter promised to avenge the wrongs of the Jews of Poland.


Segal's descendants were the Russian rabbinical family Paltrowitch, which produced 33 rabbis over several generations.




Works


Most of Segal's works were published long after his death. The Turei Zahav (         -  Rows of Gold ), an indispensable commentary on Shulchan Aruch (Orach Chayim), was published by 






Shabbethai Bass





 in 
Dyhernfurth in 1692, together with the Magen Abraham by 
Abraham Abele Gumbiner. The title Turei Zahav is a play on the similar-sounding turei zahav (        ),  towers of gold , in 






Song of Songs





 1:11. The title is abbreviated as Taz (   ), and subtitled Magen David ( Shield of David , after Segal's first name) in many editions.  Both commentaries (Taz and Magen Abraham), together with the main text, the Shulchan Aruch, were republished frequently with several other commentaries, and still hold first rank among halakhic authorities. 


Two years before the publication of this work, Judel of Kovli, in Volhynia, a 
kabbalist and Talmudic scholar who wrote a commentary on Orach Chaim, gave money to have it published together with the Taz. His wishes were never carried out, and his money was used to publish another of Segal's works, Divrei David ( The Words of David ), a supercommentary on 

Rashi
 (Dyhernfurth, 1690). Part of the Taz on Shulchan Aruch (Chosen Mishpat, to ch. ccxcvi), appeared separately in Hamburg in the same year, with notes by 

Tzvi Ashkenazi
. The other half, in spite of various attempts and general demand, did not appear until about seventy years later (Berlin, 1761). The Taz on Shulchan Aruch (Eben ha-Ezer), which was utilized in manuscript by 
Samuel ben Phoebus, the author of Bet Shemuel on the same part of the Shulchan Aruch, was first printed in 

Zolkiev
 in 1754.


Segal also authored responsa which, though sometimes quoted from the manuscripts, were never published. He and 
Shabbethai Kohen (the ShaK) are the greatest halakhic authorities among the 
Acharonim; their decisions are of greater importance than those of 
Joseph Caro or of 

the Rema
. In 1683, the 
Council of Four Lands declared that the authority of the Taz should be considered greater than that of the ShaK, but later the ShaK gained more and more in authority.

Cruise of Deception

Days of our Lives




The Cruise of Deception was a major 
cliffhanger and resolution storyline on the 
daytime drama 

Days of our Lives
. Billed as a  
miniseries  by 

NBC
 advertisements, it aired from 
June 7 until 
July 16 
1990. 

The story included several of the show's most popular characters trapped aboard a cruise ship with a vengeful Ernesto Toscano, played by veteran character actor Charles Cioffi. The miniseries acted as the climax of several stories that had been developing previously to it and the launching pad of several more, some of which played out through most of the 1990s. 


A storyline of this magnitude had not been developed for the series before this time, and even today it is remembered as one of the most ballyhooed ratings events in the show's history. In 2005, 

SOAPnet
 named the Cruise of Deception one of the 40 most memorable moments in Days history. 
http://soapnet.go.com/specials/days40th/article2.html



Plot Summary



The story took place aboard the Loretta, an ocean liner commandeered by vengeful Ernesto, and Ernesto's island located somewhere in the 
Mediterranean Sea. His main purpose in putting together the cruise was to exact revenge on all of his supposed enemies at once. Invited on the cruise were 




Isabella Toscano



 (

Staci Greason
), 
John Black (believed to be 

Roman Brady
) (

Drake Hogestyn
), 

Bo Brady
 (

Peter Reckell
), 
Hope Brady (


Kristian Alfonso

), 

Jack Deveraux
 (

Matthew Ashford
), 

Jennifer Horton
 (
Melissa Brennan Reeves), 


Julie Williams

 (






Susan Seaforth Hayes





), and Ernesto's #1 enemy 

Victor Kiriakis
 (


John Aniston

). Ernesto used his love of 
magic tricks to deceive and terrorize his passengers.


Several key events that transpired during the cruise and subsequent trek to Ernesto's island included: the performance of Ernesto's play  Fatal Passion,  in which Victor nearly murdered Roman/John; Jack and Jennifer revealing that Isabella was really Victor's daughter, not Ernesto's, after an affair with Ernesto's wife; Roman/John and Isabella realizing they are in love with each other; Ernesto planting a bomb on board the Loretta; everyone washing ashore on his island; Jack and Jennifer, the show's  
supercouple  at the time, making love for the first time; Ernesto slowly poisoning Isabella for accidentally murdering her half-sister Marina earlier in the series; Victor and Julie's first kiss; and Bo double-crossing Ernesto, which in turn led to the shocking climactic ending to the storyline: Hope and Ernesto's supposed deaths during one of Ernesto's  magic tricks  in an explosion while inside a cage suspended over a vat of acid. 


Following their rescue from Ernesto's island, the shipwrecked characters return to the show's hometown of Salem, USA to cope with Hope's  death  and move on with their lives following the life-changing events of the story. Eventually, actress Kristian Alfonso returned to the show four years later, and it was learned that Hope was in fact switched at the last moment before the explosion with an actress, Greta. Ernesto's fate was never revealed.




Story Chapters



Based on the NBC promos that were broadcast during the storyline, the Cruise of Deception was divided into the following chapters:





 Days 1-3: The Lady Vanishes


 Days 4-5: A Dance of Death


 Days 6-8: A Shot Is Fired


 Days 9-10: A Warning Is Issued


 Days 11-12: The Secret's Out


 Day 13: Overboard


 Days 14-18: A Magic Moment


 Days 19-21: A Daring Rescue


 Days 22-30: A Deal With The Devil






Effect on the series



The show itself prospered from the Cruise of Deception. In late 1989, its ratings were in a freefall and its popularity was on the wane. Former executive producer Al Rabin, who had helmed Days of our Lives during the popular mid-1980s period, was lured out of retirement to restructure the show. He, along with then-head writers Anne M. Schoettle and Richard J. Allen, concocted the Cruise of Deception. 


The show even changed its opening credits for the first time in its history to correspond to the storyline. At the half-way point of the famous hourglass opening, the shot faded to that of a dark, ominous-looking ocean, and the words  Cruise of Deception  scrolled into place as  Days of Our Lives  appeared in smaller lettering below it. An announcer intoned,  The story continues on 'Cruise of Deception.' 


NBC promoted the story heavily to lure kids home from school to watch the show during their summer vacation. Ratings rose due to the storyline, but then the ratings retreated, something that would not markedly change for at least the next three years.

Binomial name



 Pandalus borealis
Kroyer, 1838
































Pandalus borealis (also called Pandalus eous) is a species of 
shrimp found in cold parts of the 
Atlantic and 
Pacific Oceans. Many different 

English
 names are used, with little consensus (deep-water shrimp, cold-water shrimp, northern shrimp, Alaskan pink shrimp, pink shrimp, northern red shrimp). Often the word shrimp is replaced by 
prawn, albeit incorrectly.



Distribution


Pandalus borealis live at depths of between 10 and 500 
m, usually on soft muddy bottoms, in waters between 2


 C

 and 14 C. Its distribution in the Atlantic ranges from 


New England

, 

Canada's
 eastern seaboard, southern and eastern 

Greenland
, 



Iceland


, 

Svalbard
, 



Norway


 and the 

North Sea
 as far south as the 




English Channel



. In the Pacific, it is found from 
Japan, through the 


Sea of Okhotsk

, across the 



Bering Strait


, and as far south in 



North America


 as 





Washington




 state. 




Physiology


In their 3 4 year lifespan, individuals can reach a length of 120 
mm, with a 
carapace 35 mm long.


The shrimp are 
hermaphroditic. They start out male, but after year or two, their testicles turn to ovaries and they complete their lives as females.  However, if there is a predominance of female Pandalus shrimp, the males will delay their transformation. Likewise should there be a shortage of females, the male shrimp will begin their transformation earlier, all for the sake of maintaining balance for procreational purposes.




Uses by humans





A heap of P. borealis''



P. borealis is an important food resource, and has been widely 
fished since the early 1900s in 



Norway


, and later in other countries following 






Johan Hjort's





 practical discoveries of how to locate them.


Shrimp 
alkaline phosphatase (SAP), an 
enzyme used in 
molecular biology, is obtained from Pandalus borealis.

Root-finding algorithms




The principal 
nth root \sqrt[n]{A} of a 
positive 
real number A, is the positive real solution of the equation



x^n = A


(for integer n there are n distinct 
complex solutions to this equation if A  gt; 0, but only one is positive and real).


There is a very fast-
converging  nth root algorithm for finding \sqrt[n]{A}:



Make an initial guess x_0


Set x_{k+1} = \frac{1}{n} \left[{(n-1)x_k +\frac{A}{x_k^{n-1}}}\right]


Repeat step 2 until the desired precision is reached.




A special case is the familiar 







square-root algorithm






. By setting n = 2, the iteration rule in step 2 becomes the square root iteration rule:


x_{k+1} = \frac{1}{2}\left(x_k + \frac{A}{x_k}\right)


In the case of n = 1/2 the rule also simplifies and becomes:


x_{k+1} = \frac{2 x_k} {1 + A x^2_k}


Several different derivations of this algorithm are possible. One derivation shows it is a special case of 







Newton's method






 (also called the Newton-Raphson method) for finding zeros of a function f(x) beginning with an initial guess. Although Newton's method is iterative, meaning it approaches the solution through a series of increasingly-accurate guesses, it converges very quickly. The rate of convergence is quadratic, meaning roughly that the number of bits of accuracy doubles on each iteration (so improving a guess from 1 bit to 64 bits of precision requires only 6 iterations). For this reason, this algorithm is often used in computers as a very fast method to calculate square roots.


For large n, the nth root algorithm is somewhat less efficient since it requires the computation of x_k^{n-1} at each step, but can be efficiently implemented with a good 
exponentiation algorithm.



 Derivation from Newton's method 











Newton's method






 is a method for finding a zero of a function f(x). The general iteration scheme is:





Make an initial guess x_0


Set x_{k+1} = x_k - \frac{f(x_k)}{f'(x_k)}


Repeat step 2 until the desired precision is reached.




The nth root problem can be viewed as searching for a zero of the function




f(x) = x^n - A


So the derivative is




f^\prime(x) = n x^{n-1}


and the iteration rule is




x_{k+1} = x_k - \frac{f(x_k)}{f'(x_k)}

: = x_k - \frac{x_k^n - A}{n x_k^{n-1}}


 = x_k - \frac{x_k}{n}+\frac{A}{n x_k^{n-1}}

: = \frac{1}{n} \left[{(n-1)x_k +\frac{A}{x_k^{n-1}}}\right]


leading to the general nth root algorithm.

The Godfather Part III
''






Vincenzo Santino  Vincent  Corleone (also known as Vincent Mancini) is a fictional character from the 

The Godfather
 film series, appearing only in 

The Godfather Part III
, where he is portrayed by 
Andy Garcia in an 

Academy Award
-nominated performance.



Biography


Raised as Vincent Mancini he is the illegitimate son of 

Sonny Corleone
 and 

Lucy Mancini
. (This plotline is exclusive to the movie, as it directly contradicts Puzo's original storyline, in which Lucy tells 

Tom Hagen
 she is not 
pregnant when he questions the motive for her 
suicide attempt; subsequently Lucy moves to Las Vegas and gets married to a Las Vegas doctor). Vincent has never been treated as a real member of the Corleone family and so is never given access to the family's 
criminal empire. He endears himself to his uncle, 

Michael Corleone
, by trying to protect him from rival Mafia families, and the aging 
Don takes the hot-headed young man under his wing.


Vincent saves Michael from an 
assassination attempt orchestrated by rival 


Joey Zasa

, whom Vincent then personally 
murders. Vincent's irrepressible violent streak often angers Michael, but not nearly as much as his burgeoning romance with Michael's daughter (and Vincent's cousin) 

Mary
, whom Michael fears would be endangered by being involved in Corleone family business.


Despite their personal differences, Michael appoints Vincent the new Don and head of the Corleone family, and tells his nephew to call himself Vincent Corleone. His time spent with Michael has made him into a new man: much wiser, patient, and aware of his status as the new Don. In return for being elevated, Vincent ends his relationship with Mary.  The same night the romance ends, however, Mary is killed in an assassination attempt on Michael. Vincent quickly kills the assassin responsible with a single shot to the chest.




Beyond the film


What follows in Vincent's story, according to author 




Mario Puzo



 and director 





Francis Ford Coppola




, is not exactly known. However, on The Godfather Part III's 

DVD
 commentary, Coppola explains that both he and Puzo had envisioned a fourth part to the saga, one storyline of which would deal with Vincent's reign as head of the Corleone family. Vincent, in opposition to the morals of his predecessors, was to have involved the family in drug dealing, 
trafficking, and shipping 
cocaine, driving the Corleone clan into corruption, sleaze and eventual decline. The script ends with Vincent finally being hunted down and killed in a manner similar to the death of 

Colombia
n drug lord 

Pablo Escobar
. This proposed film, aptly titled The Godfather: Part IV, would also have flashbacks to 
















Vito Corleone















's early days as a Don (once again portrayed by 
Robert De Niro) and the boyhood days of Sonny, 

Fredo
, and Michael Corleone, when they discover exactly what their father does for a living. They have composed a rough draft which has elements of the first three Godfather films, 

Scarface
, and 

Miami Vice
. 

Leonardo DiCaprio
, 
Luis Guzman, 

Ray Liotta
, and Garcia himself have all expressed interest in doing this film. So far, nothing concrete has come from the planning. The film is unlikely to happen, due to the death of Mario Puzo in 1999.


Vincent Mancini was said by Coppola to, roughly speaking, amalgamate the males of the Corleone Family. Coppola describes Vincent as having Vito's cunning, Michael's ruthlessness, Fredo's sensitivity and Sonny's fiery temper.

Binomial name



  Australopithecus africanus

Dart
, 1925
































Australopithecus africanus was an early 
hominid, an 
australopithecine, who lived between 2-3 million years ago in the 
Pliocene.1 In common with the older 







Australopithecus afarensis






, A. africanus was slenderly built, or gracile, and was thought to have been a direct ancestor of 
modern humans. 
Fossil remains indicate that A. africanus was significantly more like modern humans than A. afarensis, with a more human-like 
cranium permitting a larger 
brain and more humanoid facial features. A. africanus has been found at only four sites in southern Africa - Taung (1924), Sterkfontein (1935), 


Makapansgat

 (1948) and 

Gladysvale
 (1992).2



Famous fossils



Taung Child





Main article: 



Taung Child







Replica of the Taung Child skull


 


Raymond Dart
 was at 
Taung near 
Kimberley, 

South Africa
 in 1924 when one of his colleagues spotted a few bone fragments and the cranium on the desk of a 




lime



 worker.3 The skull seemed like an odd 
ape creature sharing human traits such as eye orbits, teeth, and, most importantly, the hole at the base of the skull over the spinal column (the 
foramen magnum) indicating a human-like posture. Dart assigned the specimen the name Australopithecus africanus ( southern ape of Africa ). This was the first time the word Australopithecus was assigned to any hominid. Dart claimed that the skull must have been an intermediate species between ape and humans, but his claim about the 



Taung Child


 was rejected by the scientific community at the time due to the belief that a large cranial capacity must precede bipedal locomotion,2 this was exacerbated by the widespread acceptance of the 














Piltdown Man













. Sir 


Arthur Keith

, a fellow anatomist and anthropologist, suggested that the skull belonged to a young ape, most likely from an infant 
gorilla.




Mrs. Ples





Main article: 



Mrs. Ples







Skull of  Mrs. Ples , shown at the Transvaal Museum in Pretoria


 
Dart's theory was supported by 
















Robert Broom















.4 In 1938 Broom classified an adult 
endocranial cast having a brain capacity of 485 cc, which had been found by 
G. W. Barlow, as Plesianthropus transvaalensis. On 
April 17, 
1947, Broom and 





John T. Robinson




 discovered a skull belonging to a middle-aged female,5 Sts 5, while blasting at 


Sterkfontein

. Broom classified it also as Plesianthropus transvaalensis, and it was dubbed Mrs. Ples by the press (though the skull is now thought to have belonged to a young male). The lack of facial projection in comparison to apes was noted by Raymond Dart (including from Taung Child), a trait in common with more advanced hominines. Both fossils were later classified as A. africanus.





Morphology and interpretations





Front view of Taung Child skull replica


 
Like 







A. afarensis






, A. africanus the 
South African counterpart was generally similar in many traits, a bipedal 
hominid with arms slightly larger than the legs (a physical trait also found in 
chimpanzees). Despite its slightly more human-like cranial features, seen for example in the craniums Mr. Ples and Sts 71, other more primitive features including ape-like curved fingers for tree climbing are also present.


Due to other more primitive features visible on A. africanus, some researchers believe the hominin, instead of being a direct ancestor of more modern hominins, evolved into 







Paranthropus






. The one particular robust australopithecine seen as a descendent of A. africanus is 







Paranthropus robustus






. Both P. robustus and A. africanus craniums seem very alike despite the more heavily built features of P. robustus that are adaptations for heavy chewing like a 
gorilla. A. africanus, on the other hand, had a cranium which quite closely resembled that of a chimp, yet both their brains measure about 400 cc to 500 cc and probably had an ape-like intelligence.4 A. africanus had a pelvis that was built for slightly better bipedalism than that of A. afarensis. 



Austrolopithecus africanus reconstruction


 



Charles Darwin

 suggested that humans had originally evolved from 






Africa





, but during the early 20th century most anthropologists and scientists supported the idea that 



Asia


 was the best candidate for human origins.6 However, the famous 
Leakey family have argued in favor of the African descent since most hominid discoveries such as the 





Laetoli




 footprints were uncovered in 
Eastern Africa.7



With regards to bipedalism



Recent evidence regarding modern human 
sexual dimorphism (physical differences between men and women) in the 
lumbar spine has been seen in pre-modern primates such as A. africanus.  This dimorphism has been seen as an evolutionary adaptation of females to better bear lumbar load during 
pregnancy, an adaptation that non-bipedal primates would not need to make.89

Louis Riel Sr.


  Louis Riel Sr. (pere) (July 1817   
January 21 
1864) was a farmer, miller, 
Metis leader, and the father of 

Louis Riel
.

Born in 
Ile-a-la-Crosse, 

Saskatchewan
, Riel was the eldest son of Jean-Baptiste Riel, dit L Irlande, a 
voyageur, and Marguerite Boucher, a Franco-

Ojibwa
 Metis.  The Riel family moved back to 

Lower Canada
 while Louis was a child.  He was educated in 

Quebec
, learning the trade of 
carding 
wool.  He joined the fur trade with the 

Hudson's Bay Company
 in 1838 and was stationed at 

Rainy River
, 

Ontario
 for several years, where he fathered a daughter named Marguerite in 1840.  He left the HBC in 1842 and returned to Quebec with the intention of joining the priesthood at the 








Oblates of Mary Immaculate







 at 
Saint-Hilaire, but withdrew a year later.  He returned to the 


Canadian West

, settling in the 
Red River Settlement on a river lot in 





Saint-Boniface




 (now a district of modern 
Winnipeg, 

Manitoba
).  He married Julie Lagimodiere, daughter of voyageur 
Jean-Baptiste Lagimodiere and his wife, 







Marie-Anne Gaboury






 in January, 1844. Together they had eleven children, and by all accounts formed a devout and close-knit family.   


Louis Riel Sr. was an active participant in the Red River Metis community. Riel emerged as a Metis leader in the defence of 







Guillaume Sayer






 in his trial in May of 1849.  This trial was a defining moment in the fall of the 

Hudson's Bay Company
's monopoly of the fur trade.  Riel continued to fight for the rights of the Metis and was instrumental in them gaining representation on the 
Council of Assiniboia and for French to be used in the 





Assiniboia




 courts as well as English. 


Riel also established businesses in the Red River Settlement.  In 1847, he opened a small mill on his farm with the support of chief factor 














John Ballenden













 with the hope of establishing a 
fulling mill operation in the settlement.  But Riel had little success with his fulling mill.  He also attempted to open and operate a carding and grist mill, hence his title of  miller of the 
Seine , but to little success.  Finally, in 1857, Riel attempted to establish a textile industry in the settlement, but the venture failed.


Although he was not a successful businessman, he showed great leadership within the Metis community.  His son Louis was likely influenced greatly by his father's actions.  Louis Jr. continued in his father's steps to become the most famous Metis leader and the  Father of Manitoba . When Louis Riel Sr. died January 21, 1864, his death was mourned by the entire settlement.

. She was involved in the creation of mankind from clay and blood. As Nintu legends states she pinched off fourteen pieces of primordial clay which she formed into womb deities, seven on the left and seven on the right with a brick between them, who produced the first seven pairs of human embryos. She may have become Belet Ili ( Mistress of the Gods ) when, at 



Enki


's suggest, the gods slew one amongst themselves and used his blood and flesh, mixed with clay, to create mankind. Also known as Belet-ili, or Nintu. Alternative forms of her name include Mama and Mammitum

Beheading of a King




Kam l ud-D n Behz d 

Heraw 
, also known as Kamal al-din Bihzad or Kamaleddin Behzad (c. 
1450   c. 
1535) was a painter of 



Persian miniature


s and head of the royal ateliers in 

Herat
 and 

Tabriz
 during the late 
Timurid and early 
Safavid periods.  



Career and style






Battleground of Timur and Egyptian King





Behzad is the most famous of 



Persian miniature


 painters, though he is more accurately understood as the director of a workshop (or kitabkh na) producing 
manuscript illuminations in a style he conceived.123  Persian painting of the period frequently uses an arrangement of geometric  architectural elements as the structural or compositional context in which the figures are arranged. Behzad is equally skilled with the organic areas of landscape, but where he uses the traditional geometric style Behzad stretches that compositional device in a couple ways. One is that he often uses open, unpatterned empty areas around which action moves. Also he pins his compositions to a mastery at moving the eye of the observer around the picture plane in  a quirky organic flow. The gestures of figures and objects are not only uniquely natural, expressive and active, they are arranged to keep moving the eye throughout the picture plane. He uses value (dark-light contrast) more emphatically, and skillfully  than other medieval miniaturists. Another quality common to his work is narrative playfulness: the almost hidden eye and partial face of Bahram as he peers out the blinds to watch the frolicing girls in the pool below, the upright goat that looks like a demon along  the edge of the horizon in a story about an old woman confronting the sins of Sanjar, the amazing cosmopolitan variety of humans working on the wall in the sample image.  This surprising individuality of character and narrative creativity are some qualities that distinguish Bezhad's works and that match their literary intent. Behzad also uses 
Sufi symbolism and symbolic colour to convey meaning. He introduced greater naturalism to  Persian painting, particularly in the depiction of more individualised figures and the use of realistic gestures and expressions.


Behzad's most famous works include  The Seduction of Yusuf  from 

Sa'di
's 




Bustan



 of 1488, and paintings from the British Library's 
Nizami manuscript of 1494-95 - particularly scenes from 
Layla and Majnun and the Haft Paykar (see accompanying image).  The attribution of specific paintings to Behzad himself is often problematic (and, many academics would now argue, unimportant),1 but the majority of works commonly attributed to him date from 1488 to 1495.


He is also mentioned in Orhan Pamuk's famous novel  My Name is Red  as one of the greatest Persian miniature painters. In Pamuk's novel it is said that Kamal al-Din Behzad blinded himself with a needle.




Biography



Behzad lived and worked in 

Herat
 (in present day 

Afghanistan
) under the Timurids, and later in 

Tabriz
 under the Safavid dynasty. An orphan,  he was raised by the prominent painter Mirak Naqqash, and was a protege of 
Mir Ali Shir Nava'i.  His major patrons in Herat were the Timurid sultan 









Husayn Bayqarah








 (ruled 1469 - 1506) and other 
amirs in his circle.  After the fall of the Timurids, he was employed by 
Shah Ismail I Safavi in Tabriz, where, as director of the royal atelier, he had a decisive impact on the development of later Safavid painting.
Behzad died in 1535 and his tomb is located in 

Tabriz

Parliaments by country
Government of Monaco




The National Council (

French
: Conseil National) is the 
parliament (legislative body) of the 
Principality of 

Monaco
. Its twenty four members are elected from lists by 
universal suffrage for five-year terms, and though it may act independently of the 

Prince
, he may dissolve it at any time, provided that new 


elections

 be held within three months. 

The Council meets at least twice per year to vote on the country's budget and vote on the bills proposed by the Prince's government. Ordinances (executive orders) are debated in the 


Council of Government

 and, once approved, must be submitted to the Prince within eighty days for his signature, which makes them legally enforceable. If he does not express opposition within ten days of submission, they become valid. The current president of the national council is 
Stephane Valeri of 


UPM

 who was elected in February 2003.

J ran Hisao

6 April 1902(1902-04-06)







In this 
Japanese name, the 
family name is Hisao.

Juran Hisao (    , Hisao J ran); (
6 April 
1902 - 
6 October 
1957) was the 
pen-name of a Japanese author of popular fiction in 
Showa period 
Japan. His real name was Masao Abe (     , Abe Masao).



Early life


J ran was a native of 
Hakodate on the northern Japanese island of 
Hokkaid . While working for the Hakodate branch of the 

Mainichi Shimbun
 newspaper, he wrote poetry and drama his spare time. 


In 1926, he moved to 













Tokyo












, where he convinced the playwright, 






Kunio Kishida





, to accept him as a student. In 1929, he went to 

Paris
, 

France
 to study 
physics and at the same time, he was able to learn about the 
French theater from the actor-director, 






Charles Dullin





.




Career

 
On returning to Japan, he obtained a post as an assistant stage director with the New Tsukiji Theater. However, his interests were very broadly based, and he also contributed mystery stories to the magazine Shin Seinen ( New Youth ). His fiction included the dark detective story Kinro ( Golden Wolf ). His short story, Suzuki Mondo, won the 11th 



Naoki Prize


 in 1951, and his novelette Boshizo, earlier serialized in the Mainichi Shimbun, gained him first place in a 










New York Herald Tribune









 
short story contest in 1955.


Hisao Juran was a pioneer in the use of 
black humor in Japanese literature. His works reflect his extensive knowledge of a wide range of subjects, and displayed extraordinary skills, and range from mystery tales to humor, and both historical and contemporary settings.


Hisao Juran was married to the niece of 
Osaragi Jiro's wife. In 1943, he was drafted into the 

Imperial Japanese Navy
 and sent to the 
South Pacific. He returned safely in 1944. He lived in 

Kamakura
, 
Kanagawa prefecture from 1947 until his death of 
esophageal cancer at the age of 55. His grave is at the 








Zaimokuza







 Reien Cemetery in Kamakura.

The giant hutias are an 
extinct group of large 
rodents known from 
fossil and 
subfossil material in the West Indies.  One species, 
Amblyrhiza inundata, is estimated to have weighed between 50 and 200 kg (110 and 440 lb), big specimens being as large as an 
American Black Bear.  This is much larger than 
Capybara, the largest rodent living today, but still much smaller than 






Phoberomys pattersoni





 and 
Phoberomys insolita, the largest rodents presently known. These animals may have persisted into historic times and were probably used as a food source by aboriginal humans.  All giant hutias are in a  single family Heptaxodontidae, which contains no living species.


 Taxonomy 


The giant hutias are divided into two subfamilies, five genera, and six species.

Robert E. Lee  Bob  Pettit (born December 12, 1932, in 

Baton Rouge, Louisiana
, U.S.) is a retired American professional 
basketball player. He played 11 seasons in the 

NBA
, all with the 










Milwaukee/St. Louis Hawks









 (1954-1965). He was the first recipient of the 



NBA's Most Valuable Player Award


. He was inducted into the 









Basketball Hall of Fame








 in 1971.  He also went by the nickname  Dutch  in college.



Humble beginnings


Pettit's basketball career had humble beginnings. At 
Baton Rouge High School, he was cut from the varsity basketball team as both a freshman and sophomore. His father, 
Sheriff of 

East Baton Rouge Parish
 (1932-1936), pushed him to practice in the backyard of the Kemmerly house until he improved his skills. It worked: Pettit became a starter as a junior, and led Baton Rouge High to its first State Championship in more than 20 games in his senior year.




Louisiana State University


After high school, Pettit accepted a 
scholarship to play at 

Louisiana State University
. He was a three-time All-

Southeastern Conference
 selection and a two-time 
All American as a member of the 

LSU men's basketball team
.  (Freshmen were not allowed to play varsity basketball in those days.) During those three years, Pettit averaged 27.8 points per game.  He was also a member of the Zeta Zeta Chapter of 

Delta Kappa Epsilon
 at LSU.  


Pettit made his varsity debut at LSU in 1952.  He led the SEC in scoring for his first of three consecutive seasons, averaging 25.5 points per game.  He also averaged 13.1 rebounds per game, helped his team to a second-place finish in the league, and was selected to the All-SEC team.


During his junior year, Pettit led the Tigers to their second SEC Title (their first came in 1935) and their first 
NCAA Final Four. He averaged 24.9 points and 13.9 rebounds per game for the 1953 season.  He was honored with selections to both the All-SEC and All-American teams.


Petit averaged 31.4 points and 17.3 rebounds per game during his senior year and once again led LSU to an SEC Championship and garnered All-SEC and All-American honors.


In 1954, his number 50 was retired at LSU. He was the first Tiger athlete in any sport to receive this distinction. In 1999, he was named Living Legend for LSU at the SEC Basketball Tournament. He is a member of the 
LSU Hall of Fame.  Bob Pettit Boulevard in Baton Rouge, LA is named after him.




Pro basketball


In 1954, the 










Milwaukee Hawks









 selected Pettit in the first round of the 
NBA Draft. Many were skeptical about Pettit making the transition from college to the rough-and-tumble NBA. Rookies often struggle adjusting to the pro game, but not Pettit   in 1955 he won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award after averaging 20.4 points and 
13.8 rebounds per game. After this season, the Hawks moved to 

St. Louis
. 


Pettit was moved to forward as a pro.  In college I played the standing pivot,  he said in a 
April 1957 issue of SPORT magazine interview.  My back was to the basket. In the pros, I'm always outside. Everything I do is facing the basket now. That was my chief difficulty in adjusting, the fact that I had never played forward before. 


In his second season, Pettit won his first scoring title with a 25.7 average, and led the league in rebounding (1164 for a 16.2 average). He was also named MVP of the 
1956 NBA All-Star Game after scoring 20 points with 24 rebounds; he would win subsequent MVP All-Star Game honors in 
1958, 
1959, and 
1962. He also won his first of two 



NBA regular season MVP awards


 (the other was in 1959). 


In 1958, Pettit, 

Ed Macauley
 and 

Cliff Hagan
 led the Hawks to an NBA Championship, defeating the 

Bill Russell
-led 










Boston Celtics









 in the 






NBA Finals





 (the Hawks had acquired Macauley and Hagan from Boston for the draft rights to Russell).  Pettit put an exclamation point on the Hawks' 110-109 game 6 victory by scoring a then-playoff record of 50 points.   Both teams would also meet in the 1957, 1960 and 1961 Finals, with Boston winning each time.


Pettit's league leading scoring average of 29.2 points per game in the 
1958-59 season was an NBA record at the time, that season he was also named as the 

Sporting News
 NBA MVP. In the 
1960-61 season, Pettit pulled down 
20.3 rebounds per game, making him one of only five players to ever break the 20 rpg barrier.  In the following season, he scored a career best 31.1 points per game.  


Pettit ended his career in 1965, becoming the first NBA player to eclipse the 20,000 points mark (20,880 for a 26.4 average). His 12,849 rebounds were second most in league history at the time he retired, and his 16.2 rebounds per game career average remains third only to 












Wilt Chamberlain











 and 

Bill Russell
. 


Pettit was an NBA All-Star in each of his 11 seasons, was named to the All-NBA First Team ten times, and was name to the All-NBA Second Team once.  Pettit still holds the top two NBA All-Star Game rebounding performances with 26 in 1958 and 27 in 1962, and has the second highest All-Star Game points per game average with 20.4 (behind only 

Oscar Robertson
).  Pettit averaged at least 20 points per game and at least 12 rebounds per game in each of his 11 NBA seasons.   No other retired player in NBA history other than Pettit and 

Alex Groza
 has averaged more than 20 points per game in every season they've played (note: Michael Jordan averaged exactly 20 points per game in his final season).


In 1971, he was inducted into the 









Basketball Hall of Fame








.




Revolutionizing the  power forward 


Pettit is often credited as revolutionizing the 
power forward position in the NBA. Because of his scoring and rebounding ability, he is considered the predecessor to

The site of Rhamnous (Greek:        ), the remote northernmost 
deme of 


Attica

, lies 39km NE of Athens and 12.4km NNE of 








Marathon







, 

Greece
 overlooking the 


Euboean Strait

.  Rhamnous was strategically significant enough to be fortified and receive an Athenian garrison of ephebes (young men).  A fortified 
acropolis dominates the two small harbors, into which grain was imported for Athens during the 

Peloponnesian War
.  These harbors are located on either side of the fortified hill and have extensively silted up since antiquity.  The site was known in Antiquity for its sanctuary of 




Nemesis



1, the implacable avenging goddess whose sanctuary here was the most important one dedicated to her in 
ancient Greece.  Many grave monuments have been recovered from burials along the road from Rhamnous to Marathon, on which the sanctuary was also sited.



 Sanctuary of Nemesis 





View of the 5th BCE (L) and Archaic (R) temples looking east.



On the road between Rhamnous and Marathon, around 630m south of the fortified deme site, there was a sanctuary of Nemesis built on a platform with a well-built 44m terrace wall at 38 13'3.88 N, 24  1'37.07 E.  During its time of use the sanctuary was not isolated, but rather was in close proximity to a number of houses and other structures scattered in the vicinity.  In the Roman period c. 46 CE, dedications were made to the deified Livia Augusta (wife of Augustus) and to the emperor Claudius.  In the 2nd century CE, 








Herodes Atticus







 made dedications of busts of the emperors 

Marcus Aurelius
 and 

Lucius Verus
 as well as a statue of his pupil Polydeucion.  The cult of Nemesis at Rhamnous came to a formal end with the decree of the Byzantine emperor 

Arcadius
 in 399 CE that instructed any surviving polytheist temples in the countryside to be destroyed. 2



 Early 6th century BCE temple 


The earliest known structure dates to the early 6th century and is known only by its terracotta roof tiles of Laconian type.  




 Late 6th century BCE temple 


The late 6th BCE Temple of Nemesis was 
distyle in antis in plan and built with 
poros stone.  This temple was probably destroyed by the Persians in 
480 BCE.  The site of this temple remained in ruins until the larger late 5th BCE temple was built to replace it. 




 Early 5th century BCE small temple 





The small temple (L) and late 5th BCE temple (R) looking west.



In the early 5th BCE, a small temple (6.15 by 9.9m) was built immediately south of the ruins of the late 6th BCE temple.  Pottery found under the temple dates no later than the early 5th BCE.  There are several cuttings on the steps of this temple for the insertion of 
stelai.  The temple was built of local dark marble and roofed with terracotta tiles.  The walls of the cella and the terrace wall of the sanctuary platform are built in the Lesbian polygonal style of masonry.  Based on the dedicatory inscriptions on two marble seats of the 4th century BCE that were sited on the porch, the smaller temple is thought to have been jointly dedicated to Nemesis and to 




Themis



.  This may show that Themis was originally venerated here in conjunction with Nemesis: one the personification of Right Order and the other the avenger of Order's transgressors.  This structure survived into the 4th century CE.  A statue of Themis and several other dedications, unearthed in the 
cella, are at the 
















National Archaeological Museum, Athens















.




 Late 5th century BCE large temple 





Unfinished fluting and carving on the 5th BCE temple.



The destroyed late 6th BCE poros temple was functionally replaced by a 6x12 






Doric





 
peripteral temple in the late 5th century BCE measuring 10.05 by 21.4m.  The euthynteria and lowest step of the crepidoma were made from local dark marble, while the rest was constructed of white marble.  There were no pedimental sculptures, nor were the 
metopes decorated with sculpture.  The roof was decorated with sculptural 
acroteria, however.  For unknown reasons the carving of the flutes on the columns was not done.  The stylobate blocks were left unfinished, retaining the protective excess marble over their easily damaged corners and upper surfaces.  


The cella of the new temple housed the cult figure of Nemesis alone, carved by Agorakritos, a pupil of 
Pheidias, from the block of Parian marble alleged to have been brought by the over-confident Persians for their triumphal 
stele.  The famous statue 3 of the goddess stood within the cella of the temple and was around 4m high. The Roman historian and connoisseur 

Varro
 rated it the finest example of Greek sculpture (Pliny). The base has been reconstructed from the hundreds of fragments that were found scattered about after the destruction of the cult image by early Christians.  On three sides of the base, the nearly-in-the-round scene shows the presentation of 






Helen





 to her mother Nemesis by 
Leda. 4  The base was capped with a course of dark Hymettian marble.





 Rhamnous deme site 





Southern gate of the fortified site.



Occupying a c. 28m high hill between two bays, the fortified site of Rhamnous covered a site of approximately 230 by 270m.  The fortification walls were constructed of the local marble from Agia Marina.  As has been noted above, there were significant numbers of structures and inhabitants outside the walls of the fortified area.

Bowes Park railway station is in the 

London Borough of Haringey
 in north 

London
, and is on the boundary of 
Travelcard Zone 3 and 
Travelcard Zone 4. The station and all trains serving it are operated by 

First Capital Connect
, on the 




Hertford Loop Line



. It was first opened by the 


GNR

 in 1880, some nine years after the Loop Line itself was completed.

The station is a short walk from 



Bounds Green tube station


 on the 
Piccadilly Line. It has an unusual location in that it is situated between two quiet residential cul-de-sacs and is accessed from a footbridge over the railway line which divides those streets. 


To the north of the station is a single siding in between the running tracks which is occasionally used to turn around 
GNER 

InterCity 225
 trains heading for 




Bounds Green Depot



. A connection to the now disused 


GER

 




Palace Gates Line



 whose terminus, 
Palace Gates (Wood Green), lay just to the south, was made in 1929.



Services



The service from the station runs to 

Moorgate
 on weekdays until about 10.00pm, and into 
London King's Cross after 10.00pm Mondays to Fridays and all day on Saturdays and Sundays. On weekdays the service uses 

class 313
 
EMUs, as these are the only units cleared to Moorgate, at weekends 

class 317
 EMUs are used instead.


The typical off-peak service is 3 trains per hour to 

Moorgate
, and 3 trains per hour to 

Hertford North
, with one per hour extended to 
Letchworth Garden City via 









Stevenage








.
